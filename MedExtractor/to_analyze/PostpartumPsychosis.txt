Postpartum psychosis

Postpartum psychosis is a serious mental health illness that can affect someone soon after having a baby. It affects around 1 in 500 mothers after giving birth.

Many people who have given birth will experience mild mood changes after having a baby, known as the "baby blues". This is normal and usually only lasts for a few days.

But postpartum psychosis is very different from the "baby blues". It's a serious mental illness and should be treated as a medical emergency.

It's sometimes called puerperal psychosis or postnatal psychosis.
Symptoms of postpartum psychosis

Symptoms usually start suddenly within the first 2 weeks after giving birth - often within hours or days of giving birth. More rarely, they can develop several weeks after the baby is born.

Symptoms can include:

    hallucinations - hearing, seeing, smelling or feeling things that are not there
    delusions – thoughts or beliefs that are unlikely to be true
    a manic mood – talking and thinking too much or too quickly, feeling "high" or "on top of the world"
    a low mood – showing signs of depression, being withdrawn or tearful, lacking energy, having a loss of appetite, anxiety, agitation or trouble sleeping
    sometimes a mixture of both a manic mood and a low mood - or rapidly changing moods
    loss of inhibitions
    feeling suspicious or fearful
    restlessness
    feeling very confused
    behaving in a way that's out of character
