Skin picking disorder

Also called dermatillomania or excoriation disorder, skin picking disorder is where you cannot stop picking at your skin. There are things you can try to help yourself, but some people may need professional treatment.
Check if you have skin picking disorder

Most people pick at their skin from time to time, but you may have skin picking disorder if you:

    cannot stop picking your skin
    cause cuts, bleeding or bruising by picking your skin
    pick moles, freckles, spots or scars to try to "smooth" or "perfect" them
    do not always realise you're picking your skin or do it when you're asleep
    pick your skin when you feel anxious or stressed

You may pick your skin with your fingers, fingernails, teeth or with tools like tweezers, pins or scissors.
Things you can try if you have skin picking disorder
Do

keep your hands busy – try squeezing a soft ball or putting on gloves

identify when and where you most commonly pick your skin and try to avoid these triggers

try to resist for longer and longer each time you feel the urge to pick

care for your skin when you get the urge to pick it – for example, by applying moisturiser

tell other people – they can help you recognise when you're picking

    keep your skin clean to avoid infection

Don’t

do not let your nails grow long – keep them trimmed

    do not keep things like tweezers and pins where you can easily get at them

Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:

    you cannot stop picking your skin
    you're causing serious damage to your skin by picking it, like cuts that do not heal within a few days
    picking your skin is causing you emotional distress or affecting your daily life
