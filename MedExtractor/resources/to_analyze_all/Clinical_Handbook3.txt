Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia  Julie: Then, I don’t know what. Maybe I will get those old feelings again, like I have to get out.  tHeraPist: Based on everything you have learned, how can you manage those feelings?  Julie: Well, I guess my number one rule is never to leave a situation because I am feeling anxious. I will stick it out, no matter what.  tHeraPist: That sounds great. It means you are accepting the anxiety and taking the opportunity to learn that you can tolerate it. What else?  Julie: I can ask myself what is the worst that can happen. I know I am not going to die or go crazy. I will probably feel my heart rate going pretty fast because of the coffee.  tHeraPist: And if your heart rate goes fast, what does that mean? Julie: I guess it just means that my heart rate will go fast.  tHeraPist: This will be a really good way for you to learn that you can tolerate the anxiety and the symptoms of a racing heart.  The homework for this session is to continue selfmonitoring, to practice in vivo exposure combined with interoceptive exposure, and to continue naturalistic interoceptive exposure.  Session 12  The last treatment session reviews the principles and skills learned and provides the patient with a template of coping techniques for potentially high-risk situations in the future. Julie finished the program after 12 sessions, by which time she had not panicked in 8 weeks, rarely experienced dizziness or feelings of unreality, and was driving further distances. There were some situations still in need of exposure practices (e.g., driving very long distances away from home and on the freeway at dusk). However, Julie and Larry agreed to continue in vivo exposure practices over the next few months to consolidate her learning and to continue her improvement.  coNclusioN  As noted earlier in this chapter, cognitive-behavioral treatments for panic disorder and agoraphobia are  highly effective and represent one of the success stories of psychotherapy. Between 80 and 100% of patients undergoing these treatments will be panic free at the end of treatment and maintain these gains for up to 2 years. These results reflect substantially more durability than medication treatments. Furthermore, between 50 and 80% of these patients reach a point of “high end state,” which means their symptoms and functioning are within normative realms, and many of the remainder have only residual symptomatology. Nevertheless, major difficulties remain.  First, these treatments are not foolproof. As many as 50% of patients retain substantial symptomatology despite improvement from baseline, and this is particularly likely for those with more severe agoraphobia. Further research must determine how treatments can be improved or better individualized to alleviate continued suffering. For example, one of us (D. H. B.) saw a patient several years ago who had completed an initial course of treatment but required continued periodic visits for over 4 years. This patient was essentially improved for approximately 9 months but found himself relapsing during a particularly stressful time at work. A few booster sessions restored his functioning, but he was back in the office 6 months later with reemerging symptomatology. This pattern essentially continued for 4 years and was characterized by symptom-free periods followed by (seemingly) stress-related relapses. Furthermore, the reemerging panic disorder would sometimes last from 3 to 6 months before disappearing again, perhaps with the help of a booster session.  Although this case was somewhat unusual in our experience, there was no easy explanation for this pattern of relapses and remissions. The patient, who has a graduate degree, understood and accepted the treatment model and fully implemented the treatment program. There was also no question that he fully comprehended the nature of anxiety and panic, and the intricacies of the therapeutic strategies. While in the office, he could recite chapter and verse on the nature of these emotional states, as well as the detailed process of his own reaction while in these states. Nevertheless, away from the office, the patient found himself repeatedly hoping that he would not “go over the brink” during a panic attack, despite verbalizing very clearly the irrationality of this concept while in the office. In addition, he continued to attempt to reduce minor physiological symptoms associated with anxiety and panic, despite a full rational understanding of the nature of these symptoms (including the fact that they are the same symptoms he experi    CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  enced during a state of excitement, which he enjoyed). His limited tolerance of these physical sensations was also puzzling in view of his tremendous capacity to endure pain.  Any number of factors might account for what seemed to be “overvalued ideation” or very strongly held irrational ideas during periods of anxiety, including the fact that the patient has several relatives who have repeatedly been hospitalized for emotional disorders (seemingly mood disorders or schizoaffective disorder). Nevertheless, the fact remains that we do not know why this patient did not respond as quickly as most people. Eventually he made a full recovery, received several promotions at work, and considered treatment to be the turning point in his life. But it took 5 years.  Other patients, as noted earlier, seem uninterested in engaging in treatment, preferring to conceptualize their problems as chemical imbalances. Still others have difficulty grasping some of the cognitive strategies, and further attempts are necessary to make these treatments more “user-friendly.”  It also may seem that this structured, protocol-driven treatment is applied in a very standard fashion across individuals. Nothing could be further from the truth. The clinical art involved in this, and in all treatments described in this book, requires a careful adaptation of these treatment strategies to the individual case. Many of Julie’s symptoms revolved around feelings of unreality (derealization and depersonalization). Emphasizing rational explanations for the production of such feelings, as well as adapting cognitive and exposure exercises to maximize these sensations, is an important part of this treatment program. Although standard interoceptive provocation exercises seemed sufficient to produce relevant symptomatology in Julie’s case, we have had to develop new procedures to deal with people with more idiosyncratic symptoms and fears, particularly those involving feelings of unreality or dissociation. Other innovations in both cognitive and behavioral procedures will be required by individual therapists as they apply these procedures.  Although these new treatments seem highly successful when applied by trained therapists, treatment is not readily available to individuals with these disorders. In fact, these treatments, although brief and structured, are far more difficult to deliver than, for example, pharmacological treatments (which are also often misapplied). Furthermore, few people are currently skilled in the application of these treatments. What seems to  be needed for these and other successful psychosocial treatments is a new method of disseminating them, so that they reach the maximum number of patients. Modification of these treatment protocols into more userfriendly formats, as well as brief periods of training for qualified therapists to a point of certification, would be important steps in successfully delivering these treatments. This may be difficult to accomplish.  note  1.

The tragedy that is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTsD) is brought into stark relief when the origins of the trauma occur in the context of people’s inhumanity to others. in this chapter, the case of “Tom” illustrates the psychopathology associated with PTsD in all its nuances and provides a very personal account of its impact. in one of any number of events summarized dryly every day in the middle pages of the newspaper, Tom, in the fog of war in iraq, shoots and kills a pregnant woman and her young child in the presence of her husband and father. The impact of this event devastates him. The sensitive and skilled therapeutic intervention described in this chapter is a model for new therapists, and belies the notion that, in these severe cases, manualized therapy can be rote and automated. in addition, the next generation of treatment for PTsD, termed “cognitive processing therapy” by the authors, is sufficiently detailed to allow knowledgeable practitioners to incorporate this treatment program into their practice. This comprehensive treatment program takes advantage of the latest developments in our knowledge of the psychopathology of trauma impact by incorporating treatment strategies specifically tailored to overcome trauma‑related psychopathology, and does so in the context of the significant changes to diagnostic criteria in DsM‑5.—D. H. B.  DiaGNosis  Unlike most other psychological disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) requires the occurrence of a specific type of event from which the person affected does not recover. First, to qualify for a diagnosis of PTSD according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), the individual must have experienced, witnessed, or otherwise been confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. Exposure to traumatic events may take  the form of experiencing an event directly, witnessing the event happen to someone else, learning of violent or accidental trauma that happened to a close friend or family member, or being repeatedly or extremely exposed to aversive elements of a traumatic event (e.g., a rescue worker collecting body parts). Symptom criteria fall into four broad categories: reexperiencing (criterion B), avoidance (criterion C), negative alterations in cognition and mood (criterion D; e.g., memory difficulties, feeling detached, persistent negative beliefs) and hyperarousal (criterion E). According to criterion B, the reexperiencing symptoms must be experienced in one of the following ways: Memories of the trauma  62   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  may intrude into consciousness repetitively, without warning, seemingly “out of the blue,” without triggers or reminders to elicit them. The person with PTSD may experience intensely vivid reenactment experiences, or flashbacks. Intrusive memories may also occur during the sleeping state in the form of thematically related nightmares. Additionally, when faced with cues associated with the traumatic event, whether actual or symbolic, the individual may exhibit intense psychological reactions (e.g., terror, disgust, depression) and/or physiological responses (e.g., increased heart rate, perspiration, rapid breathing).  These reexperiencing symptoms are generally distressing and intrusive because the individual has no control over when or how they occur, and they elicit strong negative emotions associated with the initial trauma (Janoff-Bulman, 1992; Resick & Schnicke, 1992). Fear stimuli (cues) are sometimes obvious, such as the combat veteran who ducks in fear when a car backfires and sounds like gunfire. But sometimes the relationship between the trauma and the cue is not immediately clear. For example, one survivor of rape was fearful of taking showers, even though the rape had occurred away from her home. However, as she began to process the rape in treatment, she realized that every time she took a shower, she felt very vulnerable because she was alone, naked, had no escape routes, and had diminished vision and hearing—all stimuli that reminded her of the rape.  Avoidance symptoms (criterion C) reflect the individual’s attempt to gain physical and psychological distance from the trauma. Some have suggested that avoidance symptoms are a response to reexperiencing symptoms (Buckley, Blanchard, & Hickling, 1998; Creamer, Burgess, & Pattison, 1992; Taylor, Kuch, Koch, Crockett, & Passey, 1998). As traumatic memories intrude into consciousness, so do the painful negative emotions associated with the trauma. Thus, the individual may avoid thoughts and feelings about the trauma, may avoid situations and events reminiscent of the trauma, or may actually forget significant aspects of the trauma (criterion D1). Avoidance of the trauma memory leads to a temporary decrease in painful emotions but, paradoxically, increases avoidance behavior. Trauma survivors frequently report highly constricted lifestyles after the traumatic experience due to the need to avoid reminders of the traumatic memory and associated emotions. At least three types of avoidance behavior are required before a diagnosis can be made.  Similarly, detachment or numbing symptoms (part of criterion D) are attempts to cut off the aversive feel   ings associated with intrusive memories (Astin, Layne, Camilleri, & Foy, 1994; Resick & Schnicke, 1992). This detachment may then generalize to all emotions, both positive and negative. Trauma survivors commonly state that they no longer have any strong feelings, or that they feel numb a great deal of the time. This sort of pervasive detachment may interfere profoundly with the individual’s ability to relate to others, enjoy daily life, remain productive, and plan for the future. It is also important to note that not all trauma survivors experience emotional numbing. On the contrary, some find themselves experiencing continuous, intense negative emotions such as anger or shame. Trauma survivors may experience persistent cognitive symptoms, also classified under criterion D. These include negative beliefs about about themselves, others, or life in general (e.g., “I’ll never be able to have a normal relationship,” “Nowhere is 100% safe”). They may have distorted perceptions, often involving self-blame, about why the trauma occurred or its consequences.  The trauma survivor may also experience symptoms of hyperarousal (criterion E). This suggests that the individual is in a constant state of “fight or flight,” which is similar to how the individual’s body responded during the actual traumatic event. In this state of alert, the individual is primed to react to new threats of danger, even in relatively safe situations. During a crisis, this is adaptive because it facilitates survival. However, as a steady state, hyperarousal interferes with daily functioning and leads to exhaustion. In this state, the individual spends a great deal of energy scanning the environment for danger cues (hypervigilance). The individual is likely to experience sleep disturbance, decreased concentration, irritability, and overreactivity to stimuli (exaggerated startle response). There is evidence to suggest that this constant state of tension has deleterious effects on overall physical health (e.g., Kulka et al., 1990). At least two criterion E behaviors must be present for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The previously described symptom criteria must be met concurrently for at least 1 month to warrant a diagnosis of PTSD, and the symptoms must be perceived as distressing or cause functional impairment. A substantial proportion of trauma survivors exhibit symptoms consistent with a PTSD diagnosis immediately after the traumatic event. However, these rates drop almost in half within 3 months posttrauma, then tend to stabilize. For example, rape trauma survivors assessed at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months posttrauma exhibited PTSD diagnostic rates of 94, 65,   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  47, 42, and 42%, respectively (Rothbaum & Foa, 1992). Thus, after 3 months, PTSD rates did not decrease substantially. Another study that assessed survivors of rape trauma at approximately 2 weeks and at 3 months postassault found very similar rates of PTSD (Gutner, Rizvi, Monson, & Resick, 2006). At the first assessment, 81% of the rape survivors met symptom criteria for PTSD (minus the time criterion), and at 3 months postrape, 53% continued to meet criteria. Other, more heterogeneous events (greater variability in the severity of the event), such as combat, disasters, or physical assaults, are associated with lower rates of PTSD than rape (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995). Delayed onset of PTSD is rare and may reflect earlier subthreshold symptoms (perhaps due to dissociation, amnesia, or extensive avoidance) or a change in the meaning of the event at a later time (e.g., the perpetrator kills a later victim, thereby changing the meaning of the event for the survivor).  The introduction of DSM-5 in 2013 brought about changes in diagnostic criteria that impact research and treatment of PTSD. Whereas PTSD was classified as an anxiety disorder in previous DSM editions, it is currently listed among trauma- and stressor-related disorders. This change makes sense given that PTSD does not group cleanly with the anxiety disorders based on factor analyses (e.g., Cox, Clara, & Enns, 2002; Miller, Greif, & Smith, 2003; Miller, Kaloupek, Dillon, & Keane, 2004; Miller & Resick, 2007) and may include a range of emotions such as anger, sadness, guilt, or horror (see DSM-5 criterion D). DSM-5 also tightened the stressor criterion, and criterion D (negative alterations in cognitions and mood) is new to DSM-5.  The intrusion criterion clearly does not include ruminating about the event but it does include at least one of the following: spontaneous or cued distressing memories of the traumatic event; recurrent distressing dreams in which the content or emotions are related to the event; dissociative reactions in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) are happening again; psychological distress when confronted with internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble the traumatic event; or marked physiological reactions to reminders of the traumatic event(s).  The avoidance criterion includes two items: avoidance of internal reminders or avoidance of external reminders of the traumatic event. Only one of the two is required for diagnosis.  The third symptom criterion includes some clarified items and some items newly introduced in DSM-5. The  individual must experience at least two of the following types of symptoms: inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s); persistent and exaggerated negative cognitions about one’s self, others, or the world; distorted blame of self or others about the cause or consequences of the event(s); global negative emotional states (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame); markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities; feeling of detachment or estrangement from others; or persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to have loving feelings, psychic numbing).  Compared to DSM-IV, in DSM-5 the fourth symptom criterion is expanded beyond physiological arousal to dysfunctional and impulsive behaviors, and includes irritable or aggressive behavior; reckless or selfdestructive behavior; hypervigilance; exaggerated startle response; problems with concentration; and sleep disturbance.  Unlike DSM-IV, DSM-5 stipulates that symptoms cannot be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury, coma).  New to DSM-5 is a dissociative subtype of PTSD, which has been added due to a convergence of literature from epidemiological studies (e.g., Wolf et al., 2012), psychophysiological studies (e.g., Griffin, Resick & Mechanic, 1997); neuroimaging studies (e.g., Lanius et al., 2010), and treatment studies (Cloitre, Petkova, Wang, & Lu Lassell, 2012; Resick, Williams, Suvak, Monson, & Gradus, 2012) that have found a small group (15%) of people with severe PTSD who are also highly dissociative. These individuals appear to respond differently to treatment than those with severe PTSD without dissociative features.  In addition, DSM-5 offers separate classification for PTSD in young children, as well as PTSD in which symptom onset is not for at least 6 months after the trauma.  PrevaleNce  Epidemiological studies document high rates of trauma exposure and PTSD in the population (Kessler et al., 1995; Kilpatrick, Saunders, Veronen, Best, & Von, 1987; Kulka et al., 1990). In a national (U.S.) random probability sample of 4,008 women, Resnick, Kilpatrick, Dansky, Saunders, and Best (1993) found a high rate of trauma experiences (69%). When they extrapo    Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  lated their results to the U.S. population based on census statistics for 1989, they estimated that 66 million women in the United States had experienced at least one major traumatic event. Of those who had experienced a criterion A stressor, Resnick and colleagues found the following lifetime PTSD rates: completed rape, 32%; other sexual assault, 31%; physical assault, 39%; homicide of family or friend, 22%; any crime victimization, 26%; and noncrime trauma (e.g., natural and manmade disasters, accidents, injuries), 9%.  In the first large national civilian prevalence study of the psychological effects of trauma, Kessler and colleagues (1995) surveyed a representative U.S. national sample of 5,877 persons (2,812 men and 3,065 women). This study assessed 12 categories of traumatic stressors and found that a majority of people had experienced at least one major traumatic event. They found that whereas 20.4% of women and 8.2% of men were likely to develop PTSD following exposure to trauma, the rates for specific traumas were often much higher. For example, rape was identified as the trauma most likely to lead to PTSD among men, as well as women, and 65% of men and 46% of women who identified rape as their most distressing trauma were diagnosed with PTSD. Among men who identified other traumas as most distressing, the probability of having PTSD was 39% for those with combat exposure, 24% for those who suffered childhood neglect, and 22% of those who experienced childhood physical abuse. Among women, aside from rape, PTSD was associated with physical abuse in childhood (49%), threat with a weapon (33%), sexual molestation (27%), and physical attack (21%). As with Resnick and colleagues’ (1993) study, accidents and natural disasters were much less likely to precipitate PTSD among men and women. On the other hand, Norris (1992) pointed out that although motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) occur less frequently than some traumas (e.g., tragic death or robbery) and are less traumatic than some events (sexual and physical assault), when both frequency and impact are considered together, MVAs may be the single most significant event. The lifetime frequency of MVAs is 23%, and the PTSD rate is 12%, which results in a rate of 28 seriously distressed people for every 1,000 adults in the United States, just from one type of event.  More recently, Kessler and his colleagues (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005; Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005) reported on another large National Comorbidity Survey with over 9,200 respondents. The overall prevalence of PTSD was 6.8% in this  study; this compares to the 7.8% population prevalence reported in the 1995 study.  The largest study of combat veterans to date, the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS; Kulka et al., 1990), was mandated by the U.S. Congress in 1983 to assess PTSD and other psychological problems following the Vietnam War. During the years of the war, over 8 million people served in the U.S. military. Of those, 3.1 million served in Vietnam (theater veterans) and the remainder served in other areas abroad or in the United States (era veterans). Women comprised 7,200 of those serving in Vietnam, and over 255,000 of those serving elsewhere during the Vietnam era. The NVVRS conducted in-depth interviews and assessments with three groups: 1,632 Vietnam theater veterans, 716 Vietnam era veterans, and 668 nonveterans/ civilian counterparts, for a total of 3,016 participants.   The results of the NVVRS indicated that the majority of Vietnam theater veterans made a successful readjustment to civilian life and did not suffer from PTSD or other problems. However, the researchers also found that 31% of men and 27% of women veterans had a full diagnosis of PTSD at some time during their lives. Furthermore, 15% of men and 9% of women veterans had PTSD at the time of the study, over a decade after the end of the war. These rates translated to 479,000 Vietnam veterans with current PTSD. In addition, 11% of men and 8% of women veterans were found to have significant symptoms and distress but did not meet the full criteria for PTSD. This translated to an additional 350,000 men and women in the United States alone who were still suffering in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.  Data from the NVVRS were reevaluated using very strict criteria that only included those incidents that could be verified through historical records. Dohrenwend and colleagues (2006) found very little falsification of events and a strong relationship between the amount of trauma exposure and rates of PTSD (i.e., dose–response relationship). They did, however, find lower rates of PTSD after controlling for people who developed PTSD before or after their deployment to Vietnam and eliminating those people with unverifiable events. Using these stricter criteria, they found that 18.7% of the veterans met the criteria for war-related PTSD at some point, and 9.1% still had PTSD when assessed 11 to 12 years later. These rates should be considered minimum likelihood rates given that people can be traumatized by events that may not be verifi    CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  able (e.g., rape, accidents) in historical accounts of war. Currently under way is a study of the participants of the NVVRS, called the National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study (NVVLS), which will inform us about the long-term effects of PTSD.  More recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan saw the first attempts to assess PTSD during a war (Hoge et al., 2004; Hoge, Auchterlonie, & Milliken, 2006). Hoge and his colleagues (2004) studied 2,530 Army soldiers and Marines before and 3,671 after deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. They found that mental health problems were significantly greater among those who returned from deployment than among those not yet deployed, and that mental health problems were greater in those who deployed to Iraq compared with Afghanistan. Prior to deployment, 9% of the service personnel exceeded the cutoff used for likely PTSD, whereas 11.5% of those deployed to Afghanistan and 18–20% of those deployed to Iraq exceeded the cutoff. There was a linear relationship between the number of firefights reported and the severity of PTSD. Being wounded or otherwise physically injured was also associated with greater PTSD symptomatology.  Because the military began screening all military personnel for PTSD following deployment, a population-based study of 303,905 Army soldiers and Marines who deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, or other locations could be conducted for a 1-year period (May 2003 to April 2004; Hoge et al., 2006). As with the previous report, service men and women were more likely to report mental health problems after serving in Iraq (19.1%) than after serving in Afghanistan (11.3%) or other locations (8.5%). In this study 32,500 women were also assessed, comprising 10.7% of the total sample. There was an overall sex difference in mental health concerns, with 23.6% of women compared with 18.6% of men reporting a mental health concern. However, this sex comparison did not take into account preexisting traumas or PTSD, exposure to combat traumas or sexual assault, or other variables that might explain these differences. Also, the PTSD screen was a four-item questionnaire in which two “yes” answers indicated possible PTSD. On this screen, 9.8% of those who had served in Iraq met criteria for possible PTSD, and there was again an association between the amount of combat exposure and PTSD.  Recently, Vogt and colleagues (2011) reported on the effects of combat on women, which is a change from prior wars, as well as predictors of PTSD with a national random survey of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan  who had returned from deployment within the previous year. The researchers attempted to contact 2,000 veterans, oversampling female veterans to have equal numbers of men and women. The sample comprised 579 veterans who completed the survey. Significantly more men (49%) than women (43%) reported warfare exposure. Women also reported significantly lower levels of relationship concerns. However, men and women did not differ with regard to perceived threat, childhood family functioning, prior stressors, postdeployment stressors, postdeployment social support, or PTSD symptom severity. This study did not examine military sexual trauma, which has been found to be higher among women, perhaps explaining the equal rates of PTSD for men and women in this sample (Street, Gradus, Vogt, Giasson, & Resick, 2013).  theoretical MoDels of PtsD  As researchers and clinicians began to study and treat survivors of rape trauma and Vietnam veterans in the 1970s, they began to draw upon learning theory as an explanation for the symptoms they were observing. Mowrer’s two-factor theory (1947) of classical and operant conditioning was first proposed to account for posttrauma symptoms (Becker, Skinner, Abel, Axelrod, & Cichon, 1984; Holmes & St. Lawrence, 1983; Keane, Zimering, & Caddell, 1985; Kilpatrick, Veronen, & Best, 1985; Kilpatrick, Veronen, & Resick, 1982). Classical conditioning was used to explain the high levels of distress and fear observed in trauma victims in reaction to trauma-related stimuli. Operant conditioning explained the onset of PTSD avoidance symptoms and maintenance of fear over time, despite the fact that the unconditioned stimulus, the traumatic stressor, does not recur. Because the trauma memory and other cues (conditioned stimuli) elicit fear and anxiety (conditioned emotional responses), people avoid (or escape from) these cues, and the result is a reduction in fear and anxiety. In this manner, avoidance of the conditioned stimuli is negatively reinforced, which prevents deterioration of the link between the trauma cues and anxiety that would normally be expected without repetition of the trauma itself.  Although learning theory accounts for much of the onset and maintenance of the fear and avoidance in PTSD, it does not fully explain “intrusion symptoms” (i.e., repetitive memories of the trauma that intrude into survivors’ thoughts in both conscious and uncon    Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  scious, states such as nightmares). Based on Lang’s (1977) information-processing theory of anxiety development, Foa, Steketee, and Rothbaum (1989) suggested that PTSD emerges due to the development of a fear network in memory that elicits escape and avoidance behavior. Mental fear structures include stimuli, response, and meaning elements. Anything associated with the trauma may elicit the fear structure or schema and subsequent avoidance behavior. The fear network in people with PTSD is thought to be stable and to generalize broadly, so that it is easily accessed. Chemtob, Roitblat, Hamada, Carlson, and Twentyman (1988) proposed that these structures are always at least weakly activated in individuals with PTSD and guide their interpretation of events as potentially dangerous. When the fear network is activated by reminders of the trauma, the information in the network enters consciousness (intrusive symptoms). Attempts to avoid this activation result in the avoidance symptoms of PTSD. According to information-processing theory, repetitive exposure to the traumatic memory in a safe environment results in habituation of fear and subsequent changes in the fear structure. As emotion decreases, clients with PTSD begin to modify their meaning elements spontaneously, and consequently change their self-statements and reduce their generalization.  Cognitive theories are also concerned with information processing, but they focus on the effect of trauma on the survivor’s belief system and the adjustments that are necessary to reconcile a traumatic event with prior beliefs and expectations. The first and most influential cognitive theorist, Horowitz (1986), moved from a more psychodynamic view to a cognitive processing theory. Horowitz proposed that processing is driven by a “completion tendency,” the psychological need for new, incompatible information to be integrated with existing beliefs. The completion tendency keeps the trauma information in active memory until the processing is complete and the event is resolved. Horowitz also theorized that there is a basic conflict between the person’s need to resolve and reconcile the event into his or her history, and the desire to avoid emotional pain. When images of the event (flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive recollections), thoughts about the meanings of the trauma, and emotions associated with the trauma become overwhelming, psychological defense mechanisms take over, and the person exhibits numbing or avoidance. Horowitz suggested that a person with PTSD oscillates between phases of intrusion and avoidance, and that if successfully processed, the oscillations become less frequent  and less intense. According to this theory, chronic PTSD occurs because the trauma remains in active memory without becoming fully integrated; therefore, it is still able to stimulate intrusive and avoidant reactions.  Several other social-cognitive researchers and theorists who have focused more on the content of the cognitions in PTSD propose that basic assumptions about the world and oneself are “shattered.” Constructivist theories are based on the idea that people actively create their own internal representations of the world (and themselves). New experiences are assigned meaning based on a person’s model of the world (Janoff-Bulman, 1985, 1992; Mahoney & Lyddon, 1988; McCann & Pearlman, 1990). The task for recovery is to reconstruct fundamental beliefs and establish equilibrium. Janoff-Bulman (1985) suggested that this process is accomplished by reinterpreting the event to reduce the distance between the prior beliefs and the new beliefs. Other theorists have proposed that if one’s preexisting beliefs are particularly positive or particularly negative, then more severe PTSD symptoms result (McCann & Pearlman, 1990; Resick & Schnicke, 1992; Resick, Monson, & Chard, 2007). Foa, Steketee, and Rothbaum (1989) focused particularly on beliefs regarding the predictability and controllability of the trauma, whereas McCann and Pearlman (1990) proposed that several areas of cognition might be either disrupted or seemingly confirmed, that is, beliefs regarding safety, trust, control/power, esteem, and intimacy. The Resick and colleauges (2007) model focuses particularly on the “just world” myth and the human desire (and illusion) that we can predict and control our lives.  In a cognitive model, affective expression is needed, not for habituation, but for the trauma memory to be processed fully. It is assumed that the natural affect, once accessed, dissipates rather quickly, and that the work of accommodating the memory with beliefs can begin. Once faulty beliefs regarding the event (selfblame, guilt) and overgeneralized beliefs about oneself and the world (e.g., safety, trust, control, esteem, intimacy) are challenged, then the secondary emotions also decrease, along with the intrusive reminders. The fact that both stress inoculation training without trauma exposure exercises (Foa, Rothbaum, Riggs, & Murdock, 1991; Foa et al., 1999) and cognitive therapy without written or oral accounts of the traumatic experience (e.g., Ehlers et al., 2003; Resick et al., 2008; Tarrier et al., 1999) are effective treatments for PTSD undermines the assumption that habituation is the sole mechanism of change.   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  Ehlers and Clark (2000) proposed a cognitive model of PTSD that focuses on perceived threat and memory. Although the event occurred in the past, Ehlers and Clark propose that people with PTSD are unable to see the event as time-limited and assume that it has larger implications for the future. Individuals with PTSD appraise the event such that they believe themselves to be currently at risk. There are several ways in which this misappraisal happens. One is to overgeneralize based on the event and assume that normal activities are more dangerous than they objectively are. Individuals may overestimate the probability that the event will recur. After the trauma happens, they may misconstrue the meaning of their PTSD symptoms such that they perceive themselves to be in greater danger (false alarms are assumed to be true alarms) or interpret their symptoms to mean that they cannot cope with events in the future.  Ehlers and Clark’s (2000) cognitive theory also considers the apparent memory disturbance that occurs, such that persons with PTSD may have trouble intentionally accessing their memory of the event but have involuntary intrusions of parts of the event. They propose that because memory encoded at the time of the trauma is poorly elaborated and integrated with other memories with regard to details, context of time, sequence, and so forth, this might explain why people with PTSD have poor autobiographical memory, yet may be triggered to have memory fragments that have a here-and-now quality (no time context) or lack appropriate posttrauma appraisals (e.g., “I did not die”). Like the emotional processing models, Ehlers and Clark also propose that strong associative learning is paired with fear responses and may generalize. In response to perceptions of threat, people with PTSD adopt various maladaptive coping strategies, depending on their appraisals. For example, people who believe they will go crazy if they think about the traumatic event try to avoid thoughts about the trauma and keep their minds occupied as much as possible. Someone who believes that he or she must figure out why the traumatic event occurred to keep it from happening again will ruminate about how it could have been prevented. Those who think they were being punished for their actions may become immobilized and be unable to make decisions. These maladaptive strategies, most often avoidance behaviors, may (1) increase symptoms, (2) prevent change in negative appraisals, or (3) prevent change in the trauma memory.  In an attempt to reconcile the theories of PTSD, Brewin, Dalgleish, and Joseph (1996) proposed a dual-representation theory that incorporates both information-processing and social-cognitive theories, and introduces research and theory from cognitive science with regard to memory. They have suggested that the concept of a single emotional memory is too narrow to describe the full range of memory that has been evident in research and clinical observations. Based on prior research, they proposed that sensory input is subject to both conscious and nonconscious processing. The memories that are conscious and can be deliberately retrieved, termed “verbally accessible memories” (VAMs), contain some sensory information, information about emotional and physical reactions, and the personal meaning of the event. Although VAMs might be reasonably detailed, they may also be very selective because attention is narrowed under conditions of stress, and short-term memory capacity may be decreased.   The other type of memories are theorized to be nonconsious and are termed “situationally accessed memories” (SAMs). This type of information, which is probably much more extensive than autobiographical memories of the event, cannot be accessed deliberately and is not as easily altered or edited as the more explicitly accessed VAMs. SAMs comprise sensory (e.g., auditory, visual, tactile), physiological, and motoric information that may be accessed automatically when a person is exposed to a stimulus situation similar in some fashion to the trauma, or when that person consciously thinks about the trauma. SAMs are then experienced as intrusive sensory images or flashbacks accompanied by physiological arousal.  Dual-representation theory posits two types of emotional reactions: One type is conditioned during the event (e.g., fear, anger), recorded in the SAMs, and activated along with reexperienced sensory and physiological information. The other type, secondary emotions, result from the consequences and implications (meaning) of the trauma. These secondary emotions may include not only fear and anger but also guilt, shame, and sadness.  Brewin and colleagues (1996) proposed that emotional processing of the trauma has two elements. One element of the processing is the activation of SAMS (as suggested by information-processing theories), the purpose of which is to aid in cognitive readjustment by supplying detailed sensory and physiological informa    Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  tion concerning the trauma. The activation of SAMs may eventually diminish in frequency when they are blocked by the creation of new SAMs, or when they are altered by the incorporation of new information. When the SAMs are brought into consciousness, they can be altered by being paired with different bodily states (e.g., relaxation or habituation) or different conscious thoughts. Eventually, if the SAMs are replaced or altered sufficiently, there is a reduction in negative emotions and a subsequent reduction in attentional bias and accessibility of the memory.  The second element (as proposed by the socialcognitive theorists) is the conscious attempt to search for meaning, to ascribe cause or blame, and to resolve conflicts between the event and prior expectations and beliefs. The goal of this process is to reduce the negative emotions and to restore a sense of relative safety and control in one’s environment. To obtain this second goal, the traumatized person may have to edit his or her autobiographical memory (VAMs) to reconcile conflicts between the event and the person’s belief system. The traumatized person may either alter the memory of the event in some way to reestablish the preexisting belief system or alter preexisting beliefs and expectations to accommodate this new information.  Brewin and colleagues (1996) suggest that for cases in which the emotions are primary and driven by SAMs, exposure therapy may be all that is needed. However, when secondary emotions such as self-blame, guilt, or shame are present, cognitive therapy may be needed. Although both exposure and cognitive therapies have been found to be effective in treating PTSD, no research thus far has matched types of therapy to client profiles.  Another multirepresentational cognitive model called SPAARS (Dalgleish, 2004) was originally proposed to explain everyday emotional experience and was then applied to PTSD. This model also endeavors to encompass previous theories. The model proposes four types or levels of mental representation systems: schematic, propositional, analogue, and associative representational systems. The schematic level represents abstract generic information, or schemas. Propositional-level information is verbally accessible meanings, similar to VAMs, whereas information at the analogue level is stored as “images” across all types of sensory systems, similar to SAMs. Associative representations are similar to the fear structures hypothesized in emotional processing theory as representing  the connections between other types of representations. In the SPAARS model, emotions are generated through two routes. One, similar to the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model, is through appraisals at the schematic level, in which events are compared against important goals. A person appraises an event to be threatening if it blocks an important goal, then experiences fear. Because traumatic events are threats to survival, they are appraised as threatening and elicit fear. The second route to emotion is through associative learning, which is automatic and similar to the fear activation described by Foa and her colleagues (1989).  Within the SPAARS model, a traumatic event triggers intense appraisal-driven fear, helplessness, or horror, as well as a range of other emotions. Information about the traumatic event is encoded in the schematic, propositional, and analogue levels simultaneously. Because the memory of the traumatic event represents an ongoing threat to goals, the person is left with lowlevel fear activation, cognitive bias to attend to threat appraisals, and intrusive sensory images and appraisals. The trauma memory exists across different levels of mental representation but is unincorporated into the person’s larger mental representations; the memory may be elicited as flashbacks or nightmares. Such strong memory and emotional intrusions result in efforts to cope through avoidance.  assessMeNt  Any comprehensive assessment of PTSD must capture whether or not a life event meets the seriousness and subjective response requirements of a traumatic stressor (criterion A), as well as the presence and severity of the DSM-IV-TR 20 associated symptoms (criteria B–E). Although interview-based measures are considered the “gold standard” for assessing PTSD, a number of self-report measures have been developed in recent years to provide a quicker, less resource-heavy method for assessing PTSD. New DSM-5 criteria continue to be psychometrically validated, and assessment and research are adapting accordingly.  Assessment of Traumatic Events  The first essential step in the assessment of PTSD is to identify traumas in the patient’s history. Often this is difficult to achieve because many trauma survivors, es    CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  pecially rape and child sexual abuse trauma survivors, do not spontaneously disclose their trauma history. This is consistent with general patterns of avoidance of trauma-related reminders and may reflect shame, embarrassment, and self-blame regarding the incidents. Even when seeking treatment for mental health problems, trauma survivors often fail to recognize that their psychological difficulties may be associated with their trauma history. Kilpatrick (1983) suggested several other reasons survivors might not be forthcoming with this information, including fear of a negative reaction to disclosure, especially if previous disclosure has resulted in disbelief or blame. Additionally, many trauma survivors do not recognize or label their experience as “trauma,” “rape,” or “abuse,” especially if the assailant was an acquaintance or a relative, or if the trauma was experienced by many people, as in combat. Finally, in the absence of a strong alliance with the therapist, many people choose not to disclose such deeply personal information. It is therefore important for the clinician to forge a positive alliance as early as possible and be forthcoming about the purpose of the questioning, any limits of confidentiality, and how the obtained information may be used (i.e., diagnosis, treatment planning, research purposes).  In terms of questions regarding the presence of traumatic experiences, a behavioral, descriptive prompt such as “Has anyone ever made you have unwanted sexual contact by physical force or threat of force?” is more detailed and is preferable to asking, “Have you ever been raped?” In the latter case, someone who is married (or dating) and has been sexually assaulted may say “no,” because “rape” might not be a term that he/she associates with forced sex by one’s partner. The same problem may exist with child abuse. A client may indicate that he was not abused as a child but readily admit, when asked, that a parent whipped him with a belt until he had welts. In general, it is recommended that clinicians always begin with broad questions about experiences, then move to more specific, behaviorally anchored questions.  Some structured interviews have been developed with the primary purpose of assessing traumas in more detail. The Potential Stressful Events Interview (Kilpatrick, Resnick, & Freedy, 1991) has behaviorally anchored questions that are particularly good for assessing interpersonal victimization, as well as a range of other traumatic stressors. The DSM-IV version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995; reviewed in more detail later, and used  in the majority of extant PTSD research), includes a self-report screening scale (Life Events Checklist), followed by interviewer prompts to establish whether a trauma meets criterion A. Validation of the most recent CAPS (Weathers, Blake, et al., 2013), reflecting current DSM-5 criteria, is ongoing.  Many clinicians may choose to circumvent some of these extensive questions by using self-report measures, such as checklists, to acquire some initial information. Although clinicians should not rely on them exclusively, a number of checklists can be used as a springboard for further inquiry. In addition to the Life Events Checklist, the Traumatic Stress Schedule (Norris, 1990), the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ; Green, 1996), the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ; Kubany, Haynes, et al., 2000), and the Traumatic Events Scale (Vrana & Lauterbach, 1994) all assess a number of different types of trauma, including accidents, natural disaster, sexual assault, and threats of, or actual, physical harm. The Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa, 1995) has two sections prior to assessment of symptoms. The first section assesses 13 potentially traumatic events, whereas the second has questions to determine whether an event meets the definition of criterion A. With regard to combat in particular, the Combat Exposure Scale (Keane, Fairbank, Caddell, & Zimering, 1989) has been used widely to assess the degree of combat exposure.  Structured Diagnostic Interviews  The CAPS, developed by Blake and colleagues (1995), has become a “gold-standard” assessment of PTSD and is now the most widely used diagnostic interview (Weathers, Keane, & Davidson, 2001; Weathers, Ruscio, & Keane, 1999). The CAPS has several attractive features. In addition to a detailed assessment of individual trauma experiences, it assesses both severity and frequency of symptoms, using specific criteria. Furthermore, the CAPS includes questions on associated features of PTSD, including dissociation, survivor guilt, and social and occupational impairment. Additionally, it gives clear guidelines for assessing changes in behavior following exposure to trauma. The CAPS has a large body of research demonstrating its reliability and validity across a wide variety of trauma populations. One disadvantage is its length of administration, which, on average, takes about 1 hour, and the need for administration by a mental health clinician. The length of administration may be decreased slightly   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  by assessing only the 17 core DSM-IV symptoms. As mentioned, the CAPS has been revised to be consistent with DSM-5 criteria (Weathers, Blake, et al., 2013) and is currently undergoing testing.  The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; First, Spitzer, Williams, & Gibbon, 1995), one of the most widely used diagnostic scales, includes assessment of PTSD symptomatology and was developed for use by experienced clinicians. Although it assesses all of the symptoms of PTSD and can provide information about whether an individual meets criteria for the diagnosis, it is important to note that the interview does not assess for frequency or severity of individual symptoms. Furthermore, by using the SCID, one can only determine a count of the number of positive symptoms, thereby limiting its utility in research or clinical settings in which a continuous measure of severity may be desirable. Resnick, Kilpatrick, and Lipovsky (1991) recommended certain modifications of the SCID for use with rape victims, including more sensitive screening questions for history of rape and other major traumatic events. The SCID is being modified to reflect current DSM-5 criteria for PTSD.  Another highly structured interview, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, Helzer, Croughan, & Ratcliff, 1981), has the advantage of requiring less training and experience to administer than the CAPS and the SCID. Like the SCID, the DIS results in diagnosis but does not have continuous severity scores. One potential problem is that the PTSD section assesses exposure to civilian trauma, including sexual assault, but uses the term “rape” without any further specification. Thus, the modifications suggested by Resnick and colleagues (1991) relative to rape may be appropriate for this instrument, as well as when assessing interpersonal traumas. Kessler and colleagues (1995) also have modified the DIS for better diagnosis of PTSD in large studies with lay interviewers.  The PTSD Symptom Scale—Interview (PSS-I; Foa, Riggs, Dancu, & Rothbaum, 1993) has a particular advantage in its ease of administration and brevity. The PSS-I originally comprised 17 items and prompts matching the 17-symptom PTSD criteria in DSM-IV, and an updated version reflecting DSM-5 criteria is undergoing validation. The PSS-I can result in continuous scores to reflect frequency of symptoms or to determine PTSD diagnosis. Another advantage is its companion self-report measure (PSS-SR), to which scores on the interview can be compared. Thus, after conducting an initial interview, one could administer the PSS-SR on  a more regular basis (e.g., biweekly) to monitor symptom change, without having to readminister the interview frequently. A disadvantage of the interview is that symptoms are assessed only over a current, 2-week period instead of 1 month, so it is possible that some diagnoses may be incorrect per DSM-5. The time frame should be modified for careful diagnosis.  Self‑Report Instruments  There are now a number of self-report scales of PTSD that have good psychometric properties. Among them are the PSS-SR (Falsetti, Resnick, Resick, & Kilpatrick, 1993; Foa et al., 1993), the Purdue PTSD Scale— Revised (Lauterbach & Vrana, 1996), the PTSD Checklist (PCL; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993), the Distressing Event Questionnaire (DEQ; Kubany, Leisen, Kaplan, & Kelly, 2000), the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD (Mississippi Scale; Keane, Caddell, & Taylor, 1988), and the PDS (Foa, 1995). Most of these scales were developed with specific populations, such as rape trauma survivors (e.g., PSS) or combat veterans (e.g., Mississippi Scale, PCL), and research on their validity with other populations in some cases is minimal. Thus, it is important for clinicians to think about their target population before adopting a measure. Moreover, as with any self-report measure, there are limitations to relying exclusively on questionnaires for diagnosis or symptom severity. Used in conjunction with structured interviews, however, they can be useful for screening purposes or for demonstrating changes over time as a result of a particular intervention. There is also evidence that self-report and clinician interview of PTSD symptoms are correlated over the course of treatment (Monson et al., 2008).  The Impact of Event Scale—Revised (IES-R; Weiss & Marmar, 1997) and the Mississippi Scale (Keane et al., 1988, 1989) are two of the oldest self-report measures. The IES-R is useful for measuring trauma impact and maps onto DSM-IV criteria, including symptoms of avoidance, intrusion and arousal (Weiss & Marmar, 1997). The original 35-item Mississippi Scale assessed both diagnostic criteria and associated features of PTSD in combat veterans; a newer version has been created for use with civilians (Lauterbach, Vrana, King, & King, 1997). The PDS (Foa, 1995), a 49-item scale designed to assess all five PTSD criteria, has strong psychometrics. Griffin, Uhlmansiek, Resick, and Mechanic (2004) found a strong correlation between the PDS and the CAPS.   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  Two measures of PTSD have been empirically derived from other scales. The Keane PTSD Scale (PK) of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and MMPI-2 has been used successfully to discriminate between Vietnam combat veterans with and without PTSD (Keane, Malloy, & Fairbank, 1984; Weathers & Keane, 1999). The Symptom Checklist 90—Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis, 1983) has also been examined by Saunders, Arata, and Kilpatrick (1990) and by Weathers and colleagues (1999), who developed PTSD subscales derived from different sets of items for female crime victims and combat veterans, respectively.  The PCL is widely used in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and military settings with a Military Version (PCL-M) that refers specifically to military-related traumas. The Civilian Version of the scale (PCL-C) assesses civilian traumas, and the Specific Version (PCL-  S) allows the assessor to identify the specific trauma of reference. Like the PDS, the PCL reflects DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD and like the CAPS, the PCL has now been revised to reflect the DSM-5 and is undergoing testing (Weathers, Litz, et al., 2013). In response to a need to screen large numbers of people for PTSD after combat or disasters, or in medical settings when time is limited, a brief PTSD screen has been developed for use in primary care settings or for large-group administrations, such as those with military personnel following deployment (Prins et al., 2004). The Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD) was developed for such a purpose and is now being used routinely in the United States with anyone returning from military deployment or receiving any kind of treatment in the VA medical system (Hoge et al., 2006). This scale has four yes–no items that represent the four major symptom clusters found in most PTSD factoranalytic studies that separate effortful avoidance from numbing. These four items were found to be highly associated with PTSD as measured by the CAPS. In fact, the PC-PTSD outperformed the PCL with regard to sensitivity and specificity, as well as efficiency. A cutoff of 3 was recommended as an optimally efficient score for both men and women, and a cutoff of 2 was recommended for maximum sensitivity.  Finally, it should be noted that only one traumarelated scale, the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995), includes scales to assess response bias. For forensic purposes, in which response bias may be of particular concern, the assessor may wish to include the TSI or administer the MMPI-2, which contains  both the PK scale and Validity subscales. In addition to clinical scales, the TSI also includes subscales assessing tendencies to overendorse unusual or bizarre symptoms, to respond in an inconsistent or random manner, and to deny symptoms that others commonly endorse. In addition to PTSD-related subscales, such as Intrusive Experiences, Defensive Avoidance, and Anxious Arousal, it also includes subscales that measure frequently observed problems: Depression, Anger, Dissociation, Tension-Reduction Behaviors, and Disruptions in Self-Perception and Sexual Functioning.  Psychophysiological Assessment  The ideal assessment includes measurement in multiple response channels, including physiological responses. This is especially true in PTSD assessment because physiological reactivity to trauma cues is one of the criteria of the disorder. However, a psychophysiological test might not be feasible in clinical settings because the required technology and expertise are not always available. Despite this limitation, it is important to be aware of the research in this area and to be alert to obvious physiological symptoms in patients when talking about their trauma experiences (e.g., signs of agitation, sweating, flushing). Research has demonstrated consistent group differences in physiological reactivity between individuals with and without PTSD when exposed to trauma-related stimuli, such as through the use of individualized trauma scripts (for a systematic review of this body of research, see Orr, Metzger, Miller, & Kaloupek, 2004). Vietnam veterans with PTSD have consistently been found to be more reactive to combat imagery than combat veterans without PTSD, even when the comparison samples had other anxiety disorders or other psychological problems (Keane et al., 1998; Pitman, Orr, Forgue, & Altman, 1990; Pitman, Orr, Forgue, de Jong, & Claiborn, 1987). Similar results have been found in people with PTSD as a result of MVAs and child sexual abuse (Blanchard, Hickling, Buckley, & Taylor, 1996; Orr et al., 1998).  The largest investigation of physiological reactivity was a multisite study of over 1,300 veterans (Keane et al., 1998). Using four psychophysiological measures, Keane and colleagues (1998) were able to classify correctly two-thirds of those who had PTSD. This indicates that whereas psychophysiological reactivity can help to distinguish between many members of PTSD and non-PTSD groups, it should not be used as a sole measure of diagnostic assessment. In fact, a number of   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  factors may affect physiological reactivity, and these must be taken into account when assessing the validity of psychophysiological findings. For example, the presence of psychotropic drugs (i.e., benzodiazepines, beta-adrenergic blockers) can affect an individual’s response. In addition to people who do not respond physiologically, some people appear to have an alternative response to arousal. Griffin and colleagues (1997) studied psychophysiological reactivity in recent rape trauma survivors using a methodology that differed in two significant ways from prior studies. First, rather than listening to generated scripts, participants were asked to talk for 5 minutes on both a neutral recall topic and their rapes. These neutral and trauma phases were interspersed with baseline conditions. Second, instead of looking at the PTSD group as a whole, the researchers examined physiological reactivity by degree of “peritraumatic dissociation” (PD), which refers to the extent to which someone dissociated during the traumatic event. Griffin and colleagues found that a small group of women with high PD responded in a very different manner than other women with PTSD. Whereas skin conductance and heart rate of women with low PD scores increased as expected while they were talking about the rape, those with high PD scores showed a decrease in the physiological measures. When the participants’ subjective distress during each of the phases was examined, the high-PD group reported the same level of distress as the low-PD group. Therefore, despite experiencing distress, the physiological responses of the high-PD group were suppressed. Griffin and colleagues speculated that there may be a dissociative subtype of individuals with PTSD who physiologically respond quite differently than those with the more phobic type of PTSD. The addition of neuroimaging has demonstrated that instead of a strong amygdala response, individuals who are highly dissociative appear to have an overmodulated response and strong activation of the frontal lobes (Lanius et al., 2010). Research such as this supports the dissociative subtype found in DSM-5.  In general, there are two major aims in assessment in clinical practice: diagnosis and treatment planning. Whether the primary purpose of assessment is diagnosis or treatment planning, a multidimensional, multiaxial approach is desirable. Because a cross-sectional view taken at a single point in time may fail to capture the full range and pattern of symptoms, a longitudinal approach to assessment has been advocated by Denny, Robinowitz, and Penk (1987), and Sutker, Uddo-Crane, and Allain (1991). Certainly for the purposes of treat   ment, ongoing assessment of symptom patterns and treatment effectiveness is essential. Even when measuring PTSD cross-sectionally, it has been suggested that multiple measures and methods be used, depending on the purpose of the assessment (Keane, Brief, Pratt, & Miller, 2007; Weathers & Keane, 1999).  Some final notes regarding assessment are in order. First, given the empirical evidence linking PTSD with increased risk of suicide, suicide risk should always be carefully assessed and monitored. The National Women’s Study (Kilpatrick, Edmunds, & Seymour, 1992) found that 13% of rape survivors had made a suicide attempt compared with 1% of nonvictims. Additionally, 33% of rape survivors, compared with 8% of nonvictims, stated that they had seriously considered suicide at some point. Furthermore, the presence of comorbid PTSD has been associated with a greater number of suicide attempts among individuals with major depressive disorder (Oquendo et al., 2003). These data highlight the need for careful monitoring of suicidal ideation and self-harm behavior among individuals being assessed or treated for PTSD.  Second, a growing body of research suggests that individuals with PTSD are at increased risk of perpetrating physical aggression against others. McFall, Fontana, Raskind, and Rosenheck (1999) found that male Vietnam veteran inpatients with PTSD were more likely than inpatients without PTSD or a community sample of Vietnam veterans to perpetrate acts of violence toward objects or others. Results from the NVVRS indicated that 33% of Vietnam veterans with PTSD had assaulted their partner within the previous year (Jordan et al., 1992). Risk of violence is not limited to Vietnam veterans. There is evidence of increased risk of violence in other traumatized populations, including women (e.g., Miller et al., 2004). Given also that outbursts of anger are one of the DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD, it is important that history of aggressive acts (under criterion E), as well as current impulses toward aggression (e.g., angry mood in criterion D), be carefully assessed and addressed.  treatMeNt  Types of Therapy for PTSD  There have been four predominant forms of therapy for PTSD: coping, skills-focused treatments; exposurebased treatments; cognitive therapy; combination   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  treatments; and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR; which may be a combination treatment). Before reviewing the research on treatment outcome for PTSD, we describe some of the treatment protocols.  Stress Inoculation Training  The earliest comprehensive approach described specifically for use with rape survivors was stress inoculation training (SIT; Kilpatrick & Amick, 1985; Kilpatrick et al., 1982). Based on Meichenbaum’s (1985) approach to anxiety, its aim is to give clients a sense of mastery over their fears by teaching a variety of coping skills. The approach is tailored to the individual problems and needs of each client, so it is flexible and can be used in individual or group settings. SIT is approached in phases. The first phase, preparation for treatment, includes an educational element to provide an explanatory or conceptual framework from which the client can understand the nature and origin of his/her fear and anxiety, and make sense of the trauma and its aftermath. In SIT, a social learning theory explanation is used. Along with this, fear and anxiety reactions are explained as occurring along three channels (Lang, 1968): (1) the physical or autonomic channel; (2) the behavioral or motoric channel; and (3) the cognitive channel. Specific examples are given for each, and the patient identifies his/her own reactions within each channel. Interrelationships among the three channels are explained and discussed. The second phase of SIT is the training of coping skills directed at each of these channels of response. It includes, in sequence, a definition of the coping skill, a rationale, an explanation of the mechanism by which the skill works, a demonstration of the skill, application by the client of the skill to a problem area unrelated to the target behaviors, a review of how well the skill worked, and, finally, application and practice of the skill with one of the target fears. Skills taught most often for coping with fear in the physical channel are muscle relaxation and breathing control.  For the behavioral channel, covert modeling and role playing are the coping skills usually taught. The client is taught to visualize a fear- or anxiety-provoking situation and to imagine him/herself confronting it successfully. For the cognitive channel, the client is taught guided self-dialogue. The client is taught to focus on his/ her internal dialogue and trained to label negative, irrational, and maladaptive self-statements. He/she is then taught to substitute more adaptive self-verbalizations.  Self-dialogue is taught in four categories: preparation, confrontation and management, coping with feelings of being overwhelmed, and reinforcement. For each of these categories, a series of questions and/or statements is generated that encourages the client to assess the actual probability that the negative event will occur, to manage the overwhelming fear and avoidance behavior, to control self-criticism and self-devaluation, to engage in the feared behavior, and finally to reinforce him/herself for making the attempt and following the steps.  Exposure Techniques  Beginning in the early 1980s, forms of exposure therapy were investigated as a treatment for PTSD. Although systematic desensitization (SD) has been demonstrated to be effective for treating PTSD in a number of case study reports and controlled studies, it was not widely adopted as a preferred treatment (Bowen & Lambert, 1986; Brom, Kleber, & Defares, 1989; Frank et al., 1988; Frank & Stewart, 1983, 1984; Schindler, 1980; Shalev, Orr, & Pitman, 1992). Because people with PTSD may fear and avoid a wide range of traumarelated stimuli, SD may require a number of hierarchies that can be quite inefficient.  Extended exposure to feared cues or to the trauma memory itself is a more efficient treatment and has been employed more widely. Known variously as direct therapeutic exposure (DTE), flooding, or prolonged exposure, these exposure techniques require clients to confront feared situations in vivo, to imagine themselves in a fear-producing situation, or to recall their particular trauma for extended periods of time. Rothbaum, Hodges, Ready, Graap, and Alarcon (2001) experimented with the use of virtual reality for treating veterans. The veteran with PTSD can take a virtual helicopter trip in Vietnam, complete with gunfire, or drive a vehicle in Middle Eastern streets, as well as experience other stimuli that may evoke memories of traumatic events.  Foa and colleagues (1991; Rothbaum & Foa, 1992) were the first to focus extensively on the specific trauma memory rather than fear-producing stimuli. Prolonged exposure (PE) is conducted individually in 9–12 weekly or biweekly 90-minute sessions. The first two sessions are for information gathering, treatment planning, and explanation of the treatment rationale. Clients are also taught breathing retraining. A hierarchical list of major stimuli that are feared and avoided is created. Clients are instructed to confront feared cues for at least   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  45 minutes a day, starting with a moderately anxietyprovoking stimulus on the hierarchy. Beginning with Session 3, the trauma scene is relived in imagination, and the client is asked to describe it aloud in the present tense. The level of detail is left to the client for the first two exposures, but thereafter he/she is encouraged to include more and more detail about external cues and internal cues, such as thoughts, physiological responses, and feared consequences. Descriptions are repeated several times each session (for 60 minutes) and audiorecorded. Clients are assigned as homework listening to the recording and engaging in in vivo tasks. Care is taken in sessions to ensure that the client’s anxiety decreases before the session is terminated, aided by the therapist, if necessary (Foa & Rothbaum, 1998).  Marks, Lovell, Noshirvani, Livanou, and Thrasher (1998) have conducted exposure therapy somewhat differently. Their version of the therapy includes five sessions of imaginal exposure, then five sessions of live exposure. During the imaginal exposure, clients are asked to relive aloud in the first person, present tense, the details of their experience, then to imagine and describe critical aspects of the event (rewind and hold). Clients listen to their therapy recordings daily between sessions. During the live exposure portion of therapy, clients (most often therapist-accompanied) progress through a hierarchy of feared, avoided, and disabling trauma-related stimuli. They are asked to practice the live exposure for an hour a day between sessions.  Cognitive Interventions  Cognitive therapy for PTSD has generally taken two forms. One form is more present-focused and typically uses daily diaries or monitoring forms to elicit current thoughts that the client has recorded during the week. These homework sheets form the basis of the cognitive interventions that occur during treatment through the use of teaching and Socratic questioning. Clients are taught to identify and to dispute their unrealistic or exaggerated thoughts about themselves, the world, and their futures with more probabilistic reasoning and evidence-based argument. Examples of researchers who have used this model of cognitive restructuring are Blanchard and colleagues (2003) and Foa and colleagues (2005).  The other form of cognitive therapy is traumafocused and constructivist, focusing on the particular meanings that the traumatic event(s) has for the client and how those interpretations of the event contradict  or seemingly confirm previously held beliefs about self and others. These distorted assumptions about the event (e.g., “I should have been able to stop the event, so it is my fault that it happened”) may maintain a belief in a just world or a sense of controllability, but at the cost of reduced self-esteem, shame, or guilt. The focus of treatment is on how clients may have distorted the event itself to maintain prior beliefs about justice or the role of others (assimilation), or conversely, how they may have changed their beliefs about themselves and the world too much (overaccommodation) in an attempt to regain a sense of control or safety in the present or the future (“I cannot trust other people at all any more”). Treatment includes Socratic questioning and using cognitive worksheets to teach clients to challenge their thinking about their traumatic events and the implications they have constructed. Examples of trauma-focused cognitive therapy are studies by Resick and colleagues (2002, 2008) and Tarrier and colleagues (1999).  Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) initially was developed specifically to treat the specific symptoms of PTSD in sexual assault survivors (Resick & Schnicke, 1992, 1993), but it has since been updated and applied to other populations (Resick et al., 2007). CPT, which can be delivered in either individual or group formats, is a 12-session, structured therapy program that is predominantly a cognitive therapy. After an introduction to PTSD symptoms and the therapy, clients are asked to write an Impact Statement, which is a description of how their most distressing traumatic event has affected them. Clients are asked to focus on any self-blame they experience regarding the trauma and the effects of the event on their beliefs about self and others. This statement is used to understand how they may have distorted the cause of the event or overgeneralized its meaning, such that their functioning has been compromised. For example, if someone thinks that he/she should have been able to stop the event, then the individual might feel guilt afterward. If a client has decided that the event means no one is to be trusted, then he/she will behave as though this is true.  Before examining the trauma in depth, the client is taught to label emotions and recognize the connection among events, thoughts, and feelings, then is asked to write a detailed account of the index traumatic event and read it to him/herself every day. In sessions he/ she reads it to the therapist and is encouraged to feel whatever emotions emerge and to complete worksheets on identified stuck points about the trauma. The thera    CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  pist begins to challenge problematic thinking about the traumatic event with Socratic dialogue. After writing and reading the account for a second time, the therapist focuses on teaching the client the skill of challenging thoughts and assumptions with Socratic questions for him/herself through a series of worksheets. The client is first taught to question a single thought, then look for patterns of problematic thinking, and, finally, to generate alternative, more balanced thoughts about the event itself, then overgeneralized assumptions about self and world. In the last five sessions, clients are provided modules to assist them in thinking about specific themes that are commonly disrupted following traumatic events: safety, trust, power and control, esteem, and intimacy. In an alternative version that is receiving increased research attention, the written account is omitted. This is discussed below in the research section.   Combination Treatments/Additive Studies  Some studies that we review below refer to the protocols as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; e.g., Blanchard et al., 2003). These therapy packages are typically combinations of various forms of exposure (imaginal, in vivo) and cognitive therapy, but they may also include relaxation or other coping skills. Some of these protocols were developed as a combination treatment at the outset or reflect additive studies in which a new component is added to an existing treatment to determine whether the extra component adds value to the existing therapy. An important distinction between these two types of protocols is that the combination treatments were designed to be a specific length to accommodate the components of the treatment. In other words, the therapy package was designed to achieve the optimal goals of the exposure or cognitive components. Additive studies must accommodate to the original protocol length; therefore, they may not be designed with the optimal amount of therapy needed to achieve the goals of the components. In additive studies, the amount of exposure, stress management, or cognitive therapy in combination is shortened to maintain the length of the original protocol being compared.  STAIR/MPE  Cloitre, Koenen, Cohen, and Han (2002) proposed that survivors of child sexual abuse trauma have problems of affect regulation and interpersonal effectiveness, in  addition to their PTSD, that compromise their ability to profit from trauma-focused interventions. Thus, they developed a protocol called STAIR (i.e., skills training in affective and interpersonal regulation) that includes treatment for these problems prior to implementing a modification of prolonged exposure (MPE). This combination treatment first trains patients in emotion management and interpersonal skills for 8 weeks, followed by a second phase of treatment with imaginal exposure. The imaginal exposure phase also includes postexposure emotional management and cognitive therapy.  Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing  Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a controversial therapy that evolved not from theory or application of effective techniques for other disorders, but from a personal observation. As originally developed by Shapiro (1989, 1995), EMDR was based on a chance observation that troubling thoughts were resolved when her eyes followed the waving of leaves during a walk in the park. Shapiro developed EMDR on the basis of this observation and argues that lateral eye movements facilitate cognitive processing of the trauma. Subsequently, EMDR has been conceptualized as a cognitive-behavioral treatment aimed at facilitating information processing of traumatic events and cognitive interventions for negative, trauma-related cognitions. In the early presentations, EMDR was touted as a one-session cure for a range of disorders. However, more recent studies are typically of traumarelated symptoms, with a course more similar to the other trauma therapies. EMDR is now described as an eight-phase treatment that includes history taking, client preparation, target assessment, desensitization, installation, body scan, closure, and reevaluation of treatment effects. EMDR includes exposure and cognitive components, as well as the lateral eye movements.  In the basic EMDR protocol, clients are asked to identify and focus on a traumatic image or memory (target assessment phase). Next, the therapist elicits negative cognitions or belief statements about the memory. Clients are asked to assign a rating to the memory and negative cognitions on an 11-point scale of distress and to identify the physical location of the anxiety. The therapist helps clients generate positive cognitions that would be preferable to associate with the memory. These are rated on a 7-point scale of how much the clients believe the statement. Once the therapist has instructed a client in the basic EMDR proce    Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  dure, he/she is asked to do four things simultaneously (desensitization phase): (1) visualize the memory; (2) rehearse the negative cognitions; (3) concentrate on the physical sensations of the anxiety; and (4) visually track the therapist’s index finger. While the client does this, the therapist rapidly moves his/her index finger back and forth from right to left, 30–35 centimeters from the client’s face, with two back-and-forth movements per second (there are now light bars available to do this). These are repeated 24 times. Then the client is asked to blank out the memory and take a deep breath. Subsequently, she or he brings back the memory and cognitions and rates the level of distress. Sets of eye movements (saccades) are repeated until the distress rating equals 0 or 1. At this point, the client is asked how she or he feels about the positive cognition and gives a rating for it (installation phase).  Evidence for Treatment Efficacy  CBT and EMDR have been established as efficacious treatments in multiple meta-analyses (e.g., Bradley, Greene, Russ, Dutra, & Westen, 2005; Powers, Halpern, Ferenschak, Gillihan, & Foa, 2010; van Etten & Taylor, 1998). They have also been recommended as first-line treatments in multiple treatment guidelines for PTSD (e.g., Foa, Keane, Friedman, & Cohen, 2008; National Institute of Clinical Excellence, 2005; U.S. Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense, 2010).  Randomized controlled trials have consistently shown CBT to be superior to waiting-list and treatmentas- usual conditions (e.g., Chard, 2005; Foa et al., 1999; Monson et al., 2006; Resick et al., 2002), and generally better than therapies designed to control for the essential and nonspecific elements of efficacious psychotherapy (e.g., Blanchard et al., 2003; Neuner, Schauer, Klaschik, Karunakara, & Elbert, 2004; Schnurr et al., 2007). Head-to-head trials have shown few differences between different CBT packages at posttreatment (e.g., Bryant, Moulds, Guthrie, Dang, & Nixon, 2003; Foa et al., 1999; Resick et al., 2002; Tarrier et al., 1999), and there have been equivocal results regarding differential efficacy at longer-term follow-up (i.e., ≥ 5 years posttreatment; Resick et al., 2012; Tarrier & Sommerfield, 2004). The addition or removal of different elements of CBT protocols have not generally affected the efficacy of these packages (e.g., Foa et al., 1999; Resick et al., 2008).  Randomized controlled trials show EMDR to be superior to waiting-list conditions (e.g., Rothbaum,  Astin, & Marsteller, 2005). However, several studies have shown CBT to be more efficacious than EMDR (e.g., Devilly & Spence, 1999; Taylor et al., 2003), others have reported no difference (e.g., Ironson, Freund, Strauss, & Williams, 2002; Power et al., 2002; Rothbaum et al., 2005), and still others report EMDR to be superior to CBT for at least intrusive symptoms (Lee, Gavriel, Drummond, Richards, & Greenwald, 2002). Although Shapiro maintains that lateral eye movements are an essential therapeutic component of EMDR, dismantling studies examining this have yielded mixed results (e.g., Pitman, Orr, Altman, Longpre, Poire, & Macklin, 1996; Renfrey & Spates, 1994; Wilson, Silver, Covi, & Foster, 1996).  In summary, different forms of CBT focused on skills development or trauma processing through cognitive or behavioral methods have been found to be efficacious in the treatment of PTSD and to have longterm, sustained effects. Studies have documented the efficacy of EMDR, although the evidence supporting lateral eye movements as an active treatment ingredient are equivocal.  Therapist, Client, and Setting Variables  Gender and Ethnicity  According to the National Comorbidity Survey Replication study (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005) lifetime prevalence rates of PTSD are nearly three times higher in women (9.7%) than in with men (3.6%). Tolin and Foa’s (2006) meta-analysis of sex differences in the risk for exposure to potentially traumatic events and PTSD indicated that women are more likely than men to meet criteria for PTSD but less likely to have experienced potentially traumatic events. Women are more likely than men to experience sexual assault and child sexual abuse but less likely to experience accidents and nonsexual assaults; to witness death and injury; and to experience disaster, fire, and war-related trauma. Within specific types of traumatic events, women still exhibited greater PTSD, suggesting that risk of exposure to particular types of trauma only partially explains the differential PTSD risk in men and women.  Because sexual assault is predominantly perpetrated by men, and is a highly personal and intimate crime, survivors of sexual assault often distrust men. Consequently, the issue of therapist sex can be relevant. Frequently, clients prefer or insist on a female therapist. The effectiveness of male therapists has not been stud    CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  ied specifically, but they may be quite effective, if well trained (Resick, Jordan, Girelli, Hutter, & Marhoeder- Dvorak, 1988). Issues for male therapists, discussed by Silverman (1977) and Koss and Harvey (1991), include the tendency for men to view rape more as a sexual crime than as a crime of violence (Burt, 1980), therefore focusing too much on sexual aspects of the experience and its aftermath.  In treating survivors of sexual assault, regardless of therapist sex, it is essential that the therapist be knowledgeable about rape and PTSD. This includes the literature on reactions to rape, rape myths, and attitudes about rape. Therapists bring their culturally learned perceptions with them, as do clients, and these can interfere with their effectiveness if they adhere to any of the common misperceptions about rape (e.g., rape is primarily about sex, most rapists are strangers, it is not rape unless the woman actively resists). Sexual assault survivors are extremely sensitive to insinuations that they might have been to blame, for example, and many drop out of treatment if they sense that the therapist might harbor victim-blaming attributions.  Similarly, combat veterans are often hesitant to start treatment with novice therapists who may not know particular war details or relevant history. It is important for therapists to acknowledge their level of familiarity and work with clients to understand more fully their trauma experiences and the context surrounding them.  The role of ethnicity in CBT for PTSD has received little attention in outcome research. This limitation, unfortunately, is not restricted to PTSD treatment research; the minority-focused supplement of the Surgeon General’s report on mental health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001) made clear that there is a paucity of empirical research on treatment for depression and anxiety in minorities. The few studies of prevalence rates among ethnic groups have shown mixed results that, in part, may reflect differential rates of trauma exposure (Breslau, Davis, & Andreski, 1995; Norris, 1992).  Two program evaluation studies compared African American and European American male veterans with PTSD. Rosenheck, Fontana, and Cottrol (1995) found less improvement among African American veterans on some measures. However, Rosenheck and Fontana’s (1996) study did not support this finding. Only a few studies to date have examined the efficacy of CBT with African American women with PTSD. Zoellner, Feeny, Fitzgibbons, and Foa (1999) compared African American and European American women who were survi   vors of either sexual or nonsexual assault. Treatment comprised PE, SIT, or a combination of the two. There were no ethnic group differences in treatment efficacy. These results were achieved in spite of an inability to match clients and therapists on ethnicity. Lester, Resick, Young-Xu, and Artz (2010) combined the datasets from both Resick and colleagues (2002, 2008) studies to examine the dropout and outcomes of treatment among 94 African American and 214 European American female victims of interpersonal trauma. The dropout rate was significantly greater for African-American patients (45% vs. 73% completed all sessions). However, despite that, in the intention-to-treat analyses in which everyone was randomized, there were no differences between the racial groups in treatment outcome. The differences appeared to be due to the fact that African American patients who dropped out of therapy benefited more from treatment than the European American patients who dropped out. Although these results are encouraging, continued attention to racial, ethnic, and cultural issues in treatment is important (see McNair & Neville, 1996).  Vicarious Traumatization  Working with trauma victims can have negative effects on therapists that have been labeled “secondary” or “vicarious” traumatization by some. McCann and Pearlman (1990) discuss this impact as disruption of the therapist’s own cognitive schemas about self and the world. Hearing clients’ traumatic experiences may be shocking and lead to lasting alterations in assumptions and expectations, which in turn affect therapists’ feelings, behaviors, and relationships. Working with trauma victims may challenge therapists’ assumptions about personal invulnerability and safety, as well as beliefs that the world is a meaningful, orderly place filled with trustworthy people. According to McCann and Pearlman’s model, an individual therapist’s reaction depends on the degree of discrepancy between the survivor’s trauma and the therapist’s cognitive schemas. For example, if the therapist’s own complex experiences have led to the development of safety assumptions (schemas) as central to his/her well-being, working with trauma survivors may be distressing due to a heightened sense of vulnerability. In addition, the therapist’s memory system may be altered to incorporate traumatic imagery that can become intrusive.  To counteract the negative effects of working with traumatized individuals, therapists should be prepared   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  to recognize and acknowledge these effects and take steps to deal with them. McCann and Pearlman (1990) recommend the use of one’s professional network as a source of support and to prevent isolation. Talking to other professionals who work with trauma survivors is especially useful because they can help the therapist to recognize these effects and normalize these reactions. Other coping strategies suggested by McCann and Pearlman include balancing one’s caseload with trauma and nontrauma cases, engaging in other professional and personal activities, recognizing one’s own limitations, working for social change, and focusing on the positive personal impact of work with trauma survivors and ways it can enrich one’s life.  “Resistance”  Clients with PTSD can be difficult to engage and treat due to their ambivalence about therapy. They may want help, but they fear confronting their memories and have difficulty trusting others, including therapists. They may also have strong feelings of shame about the traumatic event that interfere with their willingness to disclose information that they feel may lead to rejection by others. Of course, it is important to remember that avoidance behaviors, including avoiding thoughts about the trauma, are part of the criteria for PTSD. Therefore, it is to be expected that avoidance will also occur in the context of treatment. No-shows are common, and both subtle and obvious avoidance behaviors are seen throughout the beginning stages of therapy. If possible, therapists should consider treatment as starting on the telephone prior to the first session. The noshow rate is likely to decrease if the therapist expresses understanding of the client’s hesitance to come in and encourages attendance. Early in therapy, the therapist should describe avoidance as a symptom of PTSD and an ineffective, though understandable, means of coping. Labeling this as “resistance” likely only increases judgmentalness toward the client and hinders therapist effectiveness. This and other challenges in working with rape trauma survivors are discussed by Koss and Harvey (1991) and Kilpatrick and Veronen (1983). Shay and Munroe (1999) discuss the challenges of working with combat veterans with complex PTSD.  Multiply Traumatized Victims  The treatment approaches presented here have been shown to produce significant improvement in civilian  trauma victims within a brief time. The studies presented typically did not exclude anyone for his/her trauma history, and most had extensive trauma histories, even when there was an identified trauma that was the primary inclusion criterion (rape, combat). Moreover, in a secondary analysis of Resick and colleagues’ (2002) trial, Resick and colleagues (2003) showed that the 42% of patients with childhood sexual abuse (CSA) experiences in addition to their adult index trauma had significant improvements in their PTSD and did not differ from those without a CSA history. In recent years, there has been a surge in evidence of treatment success in individuals with more chronic or repeated trauma histories, such as domestic violence (Kubany et al., 2004), combat (Monson et al., 2006), and long-standing CSA (Chard, 2005; Cloitre, Stovall-McClough, Miranda, & Chemtob, 2004). This research points to the utility of evidence-based treatment for complex cases and debunks the myth that CBT only works for “simple” cases of a single trauma. That said, therapists should be aware of attending to special issues in working with these cases. For example, some research suggests that PTSD in sexual assault trauma survivors may play a role in repeat traumatization (e.g., Kilpatrick et al., 1987), although this relationship appears to be complex (Wilson, Calhoun, & Bernat, 1999). Survivors of CSA may present additional challenges (Cloitre, 1998) because their traumatization may have interfered with processes of normal development. Given that the abuse often involves a relative or trusted adult, it represents a serious betrayal by someone on whom the child depended for basic safety and protection. They may need more help with skills development as well, especially interpersonal and emotion regulation skills. In some cases, sexual dysfunctions must be addressed. This can be added to an individual treatment program or the client may be referred to a sex therapy specialist, but only after the treatment for other trauma-related problems is complete. Veterans may present with issues specific to committing acts of violence or killing others, distrust of the government and authority figures, ethnic/racial stereotyping, and protracted grief reactions (Monson, Price, & Ranslow, 2005).  Group Treatment  The decision whether to use a group or an individual format for treatment is usually made on the basis of clinical judgment and practicality. There is scant research comparing the two formats. Some interventions   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  that have been used with trauma victims are adaptable for use in either format. Recent research has shown that standardized group treatments may be successful for combat veterans and CSA trauma survivors (Chard, 2005; Creamer, Morris, Biddle, & Elliott, 1999). Recently Morland, Hynes, Macintosh, Resick, and Chard (2011) produced pilot data for an ongoing study in which group CPT was conducted through telehealth with a group on one of the Hawaiian islands while the therapist was on another island. Although the main randomized trial has not been completed yet, the findings appear promising that there will be equivalence between telehealth and in-person groups.  Group treatment has several advantages that make it popular with both trauma survivors and professionals. Koss and Harvey (1991) discussed a number of these. Group treatment reduces the sense of isolation felt by most survivors, who withdraw from interactions and believe that others cannot understand their feelings. It provides social support that is unambiguous and nonblaming. It helps to validate and to normalize feelings and reactions to the trauma. Group treatment confirms the reality of the traumatic experience and allows sharing of coping strategies. It counteracts self-blame and promotes self-esteem. Because it is more egalitarian than individual therapy, group treatment can promote empowerment and decrease dependency. It provides a safe environment for developing attachment and intimacy with others, and an opportunity for sharing grief and loss. Finally, group treatment can help trauma survivors assign meaning to the event, promoting cognitive processing.  Group approaches have drawbacks as well, and care should be taken to screen clients to assess their readiness for joining a group. McCann and Pearlman (1990) suggest that clients with severe PTSD should be in individual therapy simultaneously with group treatment because groups may elicit strong affect and memories that can overwhelm an unprepared client. For similar reasons, Resick and Markaway (1991) warn against having group members share their rape experiences during the first few sessions. Although important for recovery, the sharing of “war stories” should be done later in the group process or in individual sessions, to avoid frightening other group members or sensitizing them to other vulnerable situations. Poor candidates for group treatment, as suggested by Koss and Harvey (1991) and McCann and Pearlman, are suicidal clients; those with heavy substance abuse problems; self-mutilating or  substance-abusing clients with a borderline personality disorder diagnosis; clients with very unstable, disorganized lives; and clients who have never before spoken about the trauma or whose memory of it is incomplete.  case stuDy  “Tom” is a 23-year-old, single, white male who presented for treatment approximately 1 year after a traumatic event that occurred during his military service in Iraq. Tom received CPT while on active duty in the Army.  Background  Tom was born the third of four children to his parents. He described his father as an alcoholic who was frequently absent from the home due to work travel prior to his parents’ divorce. Tom indicated that his father was always emotionally distant from the family, especially after the divorce. Tom had close relationships with his mother and siblings. He denied having any significant mental health or physical health problems in his childhood. However, he described two significant traumatic events in his adolescence. Specifically, he described witnessing his best friend commit suicide by gunshot to the head. Tom indicated that this event severely affected him, as well as his entire community. He went on to report that he still felt responsible for not preventing his friend’s suicide. The second traumatic event was the death of Tom’s brother in an automobile accident when Tom was 17 years old. Tom did not receive any mental health treatment during his childhood or after these events, though he indicated that he began using alcohol and illicit substances after these traumatic events in his youth. He admitted to using cannabis nearly daily during high school, as well as daily use of alcohol, drinking as much as a 24-pack of beer per day until he passed out. Tom reported that he decreased his alcohol consumption and ceased using cannabis after his enlistment.  Tom served in the Infantry. He went to Basic Training, then attended an advanced training school prior to being deployed directly to Iraq. While in Iraq, Tom witnessed and experienced a number of traumatic incidents. He spoke about fellow soldiers who were killed and injured in service, as well as convoys that he witnessed being hit by improvised explosive devices (IEDs). However, the traumatic event that he identified   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  as most distressing and anxiety-provoking was shooting a pregnant woman and child.  Tom described this event as follows: Suicide bombers had detonated several bombs in the area where Tom served, and a control point had been set up to contain the area. During the last few days of his deployment, Tom was on patrol at this control point. It was dark outside. A car began approaching the checkpoint, and officers on the ground signaled for the car to stop. The car did not stop in spite of these warnings. It continued to approach the control point, entering the area where the next level of Infantrymen were guarding the entrance. Per protocol, Tom fired a warning shot to stop the approaching car, but the car continued toward the control point. About 25 yards from the control point gate, Tom and at least one other soldier fired upon the car several times.  After a brief period of disorientation, a crying man with clothes soaked with blood emerged from the car with his hands in the air. The man quickly fell to his knees, with his hands and head resting on the road. Tom could hear the man sobbing. According to Tom, the sobs were guttural and full of despair. Tom looked over to find in the pedestrian seat a dead woman who was apparently pregnant. A small child in the backseat was also dead. Tom never confirmed this, but he and his fellow soldiers believed that the man crying on the road was the husband of the woman and the father of the child and fetus.  Tom was immediately distressed by the event, and a Combat Stress Control unit in the field eventually had him sent back to a Forward Operating Base because of his increasing reexperiencing and hypervigilance symptoms. Tom was eventually brought to a major Army hospital and received individual CPT within this setting.  Tom was administered the CAPS at pretreatment; his score was in the severe range, and he met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. He also completed the Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II) and the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). His depression and anxiety symptoms at pretreatment were in the severe range. Tom was provided feedback about his assessment results in a session focused on an overview of his psychological assessment results and on obtaining his informed consent for a course of CPT. After providing feedback about his assessment, the therapist gave Tom an overview of CPT, with an emphasis on its trauma-focused nature, expectation of out-of-session practice adherence, and  the client’s active role in getting well. Tom signed a “CPT Treatment Contract” detailing this information and was provided a copy of the contract for his records. The CPT protocol began in the next session.  Session 1  Tom arrived 15 minutes prior to his first scheduled appointment of CPT. He sat down in the chair the therapist gestured that he sit in, but he was immediately restless and repositioned frequently. Tom quickly asked to move to a different chair in the room, so that his back was not facing the exterior door and his gaze could monitor both the door and the window. He asked the therapist how long his session would take and whether he would have to “feel anything.” The therapist responded that this session would last 50–60 minutes, and that, compared with other future sessions, she would be doing most of the talking. She added that, as discussed during the treatment contracting session, the focus would be on Tom’s feelings in reaction to the traumatic event but that the current session would focus less on this. The therapist also explained that she would have the treatment manual in her lap, and would refer to it throughout to make sure that she delivered the psychotherapy as it was prescribed. She encouraged Tom to ask any questions he might have as the session unfolded.  The therapist explained that at the beginning of each session they would develop an agenda for the session. The purposes of the first therapy session were to (1) describe the symptoms of PTSD; (2) give Tom a framework for understanding why these symptoms had not remitted; (3) present an overview of treatment to help Tom understand why practice outside of session and therapy attendance were important to elicit cooperation and to explain the progressive nature of the therapy; (4) build rapport between Tom and the therapist; and (5) give the client an opportunity to talk briefly about his most distressing traumatic event or other issues.  The therapist then proceeded to give didactic information about the symptoms of PTSD. She asked Tom to provide examples of the various clusters of PTSD symptoms that he was experiencing, emphasizing how reexperiencing symptoms are related to hyperarousal symptoms, and how hyperarousal symptoms elicit a desire to avoid or become numb. The paradoxical effect of avoidance and numbing in maintaining, or even increasing, PTSD symptoms was also discussed. Tom indicated that this was the first time someone had ex    CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  plained the symptoms of PTSD in this way, putting them “in motion” by describing how they interact with one another.  The therapist transitioned to a description of trauma aftereffects within an information-processing framework. She described in lay terms how traumas may be schema-discrepant events; traumatic events often do not fit with prior beliefs about oneself, others, or the world. To incorporate this event into one’s memory, the person may alter his/her perception of the event (assimilate the event into an existing belief system). Examples of assimilation include looking back on the event and believing that some other course of action should have been taken (“undoing” the event) or blaming oneself because it occurred. The therapist went on to explain that Tom could have also attempted to change his prior belief system radically to overaccommodate the event to his prior beliefs. “Overaccommodation” was described as changing beliefs too much as a result of the traumatic event (e.g., “I can’t trust myself about anything”). She explained that several areas of beliefs are often affected by trauma, including safety, trust, power/control, esteem, and intimacy. She further explained that these beliefs could be about the self and/ or others. The therapist also pointed out that if Tom had negative beliefs prior to the traumatic event relative to any of these topics, the event could serve to strengthen these preexisting negative beliefs.  At this point, Tom described his childhood and adolescent experiences, and how they had contributed to his premilitary trauma beliefs. The therapist noted that Tom tended to blame himself and to internalize the bad things that had happened in his family and the suicide of his friend. She also noted his comment, “I wonder if my father drank to cope with me and my siblings.” In Tom’s case, it seemed likely that the traumatic experience served more to confirm his preexisting beliefs that he had caused or contributed to bad things happening around and to him.  Tom then spent some time describing how drastically things had changed after his military traumas. Prior to his military experiences and, specifically, the shooting of the woman and child, Tom described himself as “proud of being a soldier” and “pulling his life together.” He indicated that the military structure had been very good for him in developing self-discipline and improving his self-esteem. He indicated that he felt good about “the mission to end terrorism” and was proud to serve his country. He felt camaraderie with his fellow soldiers and considered a career in the military.  He denied any authority problems and in fact believed that his commanding officers had been role models of the type of leader he wished to be. Prior to his deployment to Iraq, Tom met and married his wife, and they appeared to have a stable, intimate relationship. After his return from Iraq, Tom indicated that he did not trust anyone, especially anyone associated with the  U.S. government. Tom expressed his disillusionment with the war effort and distrust of the individuals who commanded his unit. He also articulated distrust of himself: “I always make bad decisions when the chips are down.” He stated that he felt completely unsafe in his environment. In his immediate postdeployment period, Tom had occasionally believed snipers on the base grounds had placed him in their crosshairs to kill him. He indicated that he minimally tolerated being close to his wife, including sexual contact between the two of them. The therapist introduced the notion of “stuck points,” or ways of making sense of the trauma or of thinking about himself, others, and the world, as getting in the way of Tom’s recovery from the traumatic events. The therapist noted that a large number of individuals are exposed to trauma. In fact, military personnel are among the most trauma-exposed individuals. However, most people recover from their trauma exposure. Thus, a primary goal of the therapy was to figure out what had prevented Tom from recovering (i.e., how his thinking had got him “stuck,” leading to the maintenance of his PTSD symptoms).  The therapist then asked Tom to provide a 5-minute account of his index traumatic event. Tom immediately responded, “There were so many bad things over there. How could I pick one?” The therapist asked, “Which of those events do you have the most thoughts or images about? Which of those events do you dislike thinking about the most?” The therapist indicated that Tom did not need to provide a fine-grained description of the event, but rather a brief overview of what happened. Tom provided a quick account of the shooting of the woman and child. The therapist praised Tom for sharing about the event with her and asked about his feelings as a result of sharing the information. Tom said that he felt anxious and wanted the session to be over. The therapist used this as an opportunity to describe the differences between “natural” and “manufactured” emotions.  The therapist first described “natural” emotions as those feelings that are commensurate reactions to experiences that have occurred. For example, if we perceive   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  that someone has wronged us, it is natural to feel anger. If we encounter a threatening situation, it is natural to feel fear. Natural emotions have a self-limited and diminishing course. If we allow ourselves to feel these natural emotions, they will naturally dissipate. The therapist used the analogy of the energy contained in a bottle of carbonated soda to illustrate this concept. If the top of the bottle is removed, the pressure initially comes out with some force, but that force subsides and eventually has no energy forthcoming. On the other hand, there are “manufactured” emotions, or emotions that a person has a role in making. Our thoughts contribute to the nature and course of these emotions. The more that we “fuel” these emotions with our self-statements, the more we can increase the “pressure” of these emotions. For example, if a person tells himself over and over that he is a stupid person and reminds himself of more and more situations in which he perceived that he made mistakes, then he is likely to have more and more anger toward himself. The therapist reiterated that the goals of the therapy were (1) to allow Tom to feel the natural emotions he has “stuffed,” which keep him from recovering from his trauma; and  (2) to figure out how Tom was manufacturing emotions that were unhelpful to him. The therapist summarized for Tom the three major goals of the therapy: (1) to remember and to accept what happened to him by not avoiding those memories and associated emotions; (2) to allow himself to feel his natural emotions and let them run their course, so the memory could be put away without such strong feelings still attached; and (3) to balance beliefs that had been disrupted or reinforced, so that Tom did not manufacture unhelpful emotions.  The therapist made a strong pitch for the importance of out-of-session practice adherence before assigning Tom the first practice assignment. The therapist told Tom that there appeared to be no better predictor of response to the treatment than how much effort a patient puts into it. She pointed out that of the 168 hours in a week, Tom would be spending 1–2 hours of that week in psychotherapy sessions (Note. We have found it helpful to do twice-weekly sessions, at least in the initial portion of the therapy, to facilitate rapport building, to overcome avoidance, and to capitalize on early gains in the therapy.) If Tom only spent the time during psychotherapy sessions focused on these issues, he would be spending less than 1% of his week focused on his recovery. To get better, he would be using daily worksheets and other writing assignments to promote  needed skills in his daily life and to decrease his avoidance. The therapist also pointed out that at the beginning of each session they would review the practice assignments that Tom had completed. The therapist asked Tom if this made sense, and he responded, “Sure. It makes sense that you get out of it what you put into it.”  Tom’s first assignment was to write an Impact Statement about the meaning of the event to determine how he had made sense of the traumatic event, and to help him begin to determine what assimilation, accommodation, and overaccommodation had occurred since the event. Stuck points that get in the way of recovery are identified with this first assignment. Tom was instructed to start writing the assignment later that day to address directly any avoidance about completing the assignment. He was specifically reminded that this was not a trauma account (that would come later) and that this assignment was specifically designed to get at the meaning of the event in his life, and how it had impacted his belief systems.  The specific assignment was as follows:  Please write at least one page on what it means to you that you that this traumatic experience happened. Please consider the effects that the event has had on your beliefs about yourself, your beliefs about others, and your beliefs about the world. Also consider the following topics while writing your answer: safety, trust, power/competence, esteem, and intimacy. Bring this with you to the next session.  Session 2  The purposes of the second session are (1) to discuss the meaning of the event and (2) to help Tom begin to recognize thoughts, label emotions, and see the connection between what he says to himself and how he feels. Tom arrived with obvious anger and appeared defensive throughout most of the session. He stated that he had been feeling quite angry all week, and that he was “disgusted” with society and particularly politicians, who were “all self-interested or pandering to those with money.” He expressed a great deal of anger over the reports of alleged torture at Abu Ghraib prison, which was a major news item during his therapy. The therapist was interested in the thinking behind Tom’s anger about the events at Abu Ghraib. However, she first reviewed Tom’s practice assignment, writing the first Impact Statement, to reinforce the completion of this work and to maintain the session structure she had outlined in the first session.   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  The therapist asked Tom to read his Impact Statement aloud. Clients in individual CPT are always asked to read their practice assignments aloud. Should the therapist read them, the client could dissociate or otherwise avoid his/her own reactions to their material. Tom had written:  The reason that this traumatic event happened is because I was friggin’ stupid and made a bad decision. I killed an innocent family, without thinking. I murdered a man’s wife and child. I can’t believe that I did it. I took that man’s wife and child, and oh, yeah, his unborn child, too. I feel like I don’t deserve to live, let alone have a wife and child on the way. Why should I be happy when that man was riddled with despair, and that innocent woman, child, and unborn child died? Now, I feel like I’m totally unsafe. I don’t feel safe even here on the hospital grounds, let alone in the city or back home with my family. I feel like someone is watching me and is going to snipe at me and my family because the terrorists had information about the situation and passed it on. I also don’t feel that people are safe around me. I might go off and hurt someone, and God forbid it be my own family. With my wife pregnant, I am really concerned that I might hurt her. I don’t trust anyone around me, and especially the government. I don’t even trust the military treating me. I also don’t trust myself. If I made a bad decision at that time, who is to say that I won’t make a bad decision again? About power and control, I feel completely out of control of myself, and like the military and my commanding officer have complete control over me. My self-esteem is in the toilet. Why wouldn’t it be given the crappy things that I have done? I don’t think there are many positive things that I’ve done with my life, and when the chips are down, I always fail and let others down. I’m not sure what other-esteem is, but I do like my wife. In fact, I don’t think she deserves to have to deal with me, and I think they would be better without me around. I don’t want to be close to my wife, or anyone else for that matter. It makes me want to crawl out of my skin when my wife touches me. I feel like I’ll never get over this. It wasn’t supposed to be like this.  The therapist asked Tom what it was like to write and then read the Impact Statement aloud. Tom responded that it had been very difficult, and that he had avoided the assignment until the evening before his psychotherapy session. The therapist immediately reinforced Tom for his hard work in completing the assignment. She also used the opportunity to gently address the role of avoidance in maintaining PTSD symptoms. She asked specific Socratic questions aimed at elucidating  the distress associated with anticipatory anxiety, and wondered aloud with Tom about what it would have been like to have completed the assignment earlier in the week. She also asked Socratic questions aimed at highlighting the fact that Tom felt better, not worse, after completing the assignment.  Tom’s first Impact Statement and the information he shared in the first session made evident the stuck points that would have to be challenged. In CPT, areas of assimilation are prioritized as the first targets of treatment. Assimilation is targeted first because changes in the interpretation of the event itself are integrally related to the other, more generalized beliefs involved in overaccommodation. In Tom’s case, he was assimilating the event by blaming himself. He used the term “murderer” to describe his role in the event, disregarding important contextual factors that surrounded the event. These beliefs would be the first priority for challenging. Tom’s overaccommodation is evident in his general distrust of society and authority figures, and his belief that he will make bad decisions in difficult situations. His overaccommodation is also evident in his sense of threat in his environment (e.g., snipers), difficulty being emotionally and physically intimate with his wife, and low esteem for others and himself.  The therapist returned to Tom’s anger about Abu Ghraib to get a better sense of possible stuck points, and also to experiment with Tom’s level of cognitive rigidity or openness to cognitive challenging. The following exchange ensued between Tom and the therapist:  tHeraPist: Earlier you mentioned that you were feel   ing angry about the reports from Abu Ghraib. Can  you tell me what makes you angry?  tom: I can’t believe that they would do that to those prisoners.  tHeraPist: What specifically upsets you about Abu Ghraib?  tom: Haven’t you heard the reports? I can’t believe that they would humiliate and hurt them like that. Once again, the U.S. military’s use of force is unacceptable.   tHeraPist: Do you think your use of force as a member of the U.S. military was unacceptable?  tom: Yes. I murdered innocent civilians. I am no dif   ferent than those military people at Abu Ghraib. In  fact, I’m worse because I murdered them.  tHeraPist: “Murder.” That’s a strong word.   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  tom: Yeah?  tHeraPist: From what you’ve told me, it seems like you killed some people who may or may not have been “innocent.” Your shooting occurred in a very specific place and time, and under certain circumstances.   tom: Yes, they died at my hands.  tHeraPist: Yes, they died, and it seems, at least in part, because of your shooting. Does that make you a murderer?  tom: Innocent people died and I pulled the trigger. I murdered them. That’s worse than what happened at Abu Ghraib.  tHeraPist: (quietly) Really, you think it is worse?  tom: Yes. In one case, people died, and in another they didn’t. Both are bad, and both were caused by soldiers, but I killed people and they didn’t.  tHeraPist: The outcomes are different—that is true. I’m curious if you think how it happened matters?  tom: Huh?  tHeraPist: Does it matter what the soldiers’ intentions were in those situations, regardless of the outcome? tom: No. The bottom line is killing versus no killing.  tHeraPist: (realizing that there was minimal flexibility at this point) I agree that there is no changing the fact that the woman and child died, and that your shooting had something to do with that. However, I think we might slightly disagree on the use of the term “murder.” It is clear that their deaths have been a very difficult thing for you to accept, and that you are trying to make sense of that. The sense that you appear to have made of their deaths is that you are a “murderer.” I think this is a good example of one of those stuck points that seem to have prevented you from recovering from this traumatic event. We’ll definitely be spending more time together on understanding your role in their deaths.  In addition to testing Tom’s cognitive flexibility, the therapist also wanted to plant the seeds of a different interpretation of the event. She was careful not to push too far and retreated when it was clear that Tom was not amenable to an alternative interpretation at this point in the therapy. He was already defensive and somewhat angry, and she did not want to exacerbate his defensiveness or possibly contribute to dropout from the therapy.  From there, the therapist described how important it was to be able to label emotions and to begin to identify what Tom was saying to himself. The therapist and Tom discussed how different interpretations of events can lead to very different emotional reactions. They generated several examples of how changes in thoughts result in different feelings. The therapist also reminded Tom that some interpretations and reactions follow naturally from situations and do not need to be altered. For example, Tom indicated that he was saddened by the death of the family; the therapist did not challenge that statement. She encouraged Tom to feel his sadness and to let it run its course. He recognized that he had lost something, and it was perfectly natural to feel sad as a result. At this point Tom responded, “I don’t like to feel sad. In fact, I don’t like to feel at all. I’m afraid I’ll go crazy.” The therapist gently challenged this belief. “Have you ever allowed yourself to feel sad?” Tom responded that he worked very hard to avoid any and all feelings. The therapist encouraged Tom, “Well, given that you don’t have much experience with feeling your feelings, we don’t know that you’re going to go crazy if you feel your feelings, right?” She also asked him whether he had noticed anyone in his life who had felt sad and had not gone crazy. He laughed. The therapist added, “Not feeling your feelings hasn’t been working for you so far. This is your opportunity to experiment with feeling these very natural feelings about the traumatic event to see whether it can help you recover now from what has happened.”  Tom was given a number of A-B-C Sheets as practice assignments to begin to identify what he was telling himself and his resulting emotions. In the first column, under A, “Something happens,” Tom was instructed to write down an event. Under the middle column, B, “I tell myself something,” he was asked to record his thoughts about the event. Under column C, “I feel and/ or do something,” Tom was asked to write down his behavioral and emotional responses to the event. The therapist pointed out that if Tom says something to himself a lot, it becomes automatic. After a while, he does not need to think the thought consciously, he can go straight to the feeling. It is important to stop and recognize automatic thoughts to decide whether they either make sense or should be challenged and changed.  Session 3  Tom handed the therapist his practice assignments as soon as he arrived. The therapist went over the individ    CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  ual A-B-C Sheets Tom had completed and emphasized that he had done a good job in identifying his feelings and recognizing his thoughts. Some of this work is shown in Figure 2.1.  The purpose of reviewing this work at this point in the therapy is to identify thoughts and feelings, not to heavily challenge the content of those thoughts. The therapist did a minor correction of Tom’s identification of the thought “I feel like I’m a bad person” (bolded in Figure 2.1) as a feeling. She commented that feelings are almost always one word and what you feel in your “gut,” and that adding the stem “I feel . . . ” does not necessarily make it a feeling. The therapist noticed the pattern of thoughts that Tom tended to record (i.e., internalizing and self-blaming), as well as the characteristic emotions he reported.  The therapist noted the themes of assimilation that again emerged (i.e., self-blame) and chose to focus on mildly challenging these related thoughts. She specifically chose to focus on Tom’s thoughts and feelings related to his wife’s pregnancy, which ultimately seemed to be related to his assimilation of the traumatic event.  tHeraPist: You don’t think you deserve to have a family? Can you say more about that?  tom: Why should I get to have a family when I took someone else’s away?  tHeraPist: OK, so it sounds like this relates to the first thought that you wrote down on the A-B-C Sheet about being a murderer. When you say to yourself, “I took someone else’s family away,” how do you feel?  tom: I feel bad.  tHeraPist: Let’s see if we can be a bit more precise. What brand of bad do you feel? Remember how we talked about the primary colors of emotion? Which of those might you feel?  tom: I feel so angry at myself for doing what I did.  tHeraPist: OK. Let’s write that down—anger at self. So, I’m curious, Tom, do the other people you’ve told about this situation, or who were there at the time, think what you did was wrong?  tom: No, but they weren’t the ones who did it, and they don’t care about the Iraqi people like I do.  ACTIVATING EVENT BELIEF CONSEQUENCE A B C “Something happens” “I tell myself something” “I feel something”   I killed an innocent family. “I am a murderer.” I feel like I’m a bad person. Avoid talking about it. My wife is pregnant. “I don’t deserve to have a family.” Guilty Abu Ghraib “The government sucks.” Angry Going to therapy “I’m weak. I shouldn’t have PTSD. Angry PTSD is only for the weak.”   Are my thoughts in B realistic?   Yes.   What can you tell yourself on such occasions in the future?   ?   figUre 2.1. A-B-C Sheet.   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  tHeraPist: Hmm . . . that makes me think about something, Tom. In the combat zone in which you were involved in Iraq, how easy was it to determine who you were fighting?  tom: Not always particularly easy. There were lots of  insurgents who looked like everyday people. tHeraPist: Like civilians? Innocent civilians? (pause)  tom: I see where you are going. I feel like it is still wrong because they died.  tHeraPist: I believe you when you say that it feels that way. However, feeling a certain way doesn’t necessarily mean that it is based on the facts or the truth. We’re going to work together on seeing whether that feeling of guilt or wrongdoing makes sense when we look at the situation very carefully in our work together.   Because the goal is for Tom to challenge and dismantle his own beliefs, the therapist probed and planted seeds for alternative interpretations of the traumatic event but did not pursue the matter too far. Although Tom did move some from his extreme stance within the session, the therapist was not expecting any dramatic changes. She focused mostly on helping Tom get the connections among thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and developing a collaborative relationship in which cognitive interventions could be successfully delivered.  The therapist praised Tom for his ability to recognize and label thoughts and feelings, and said that she wanted Tom to attend to both during the next assignment, which was writing about the index traumatic event. Tom was asked to write as his practice assignment a detailed account of the event, and to include as many sensory details as possible. He was asked to include his thoughts and feelings during the event. He was instructed to start as soon as possible on the assignment, preferably that day, and to pick a time and place where he would have privacy and could allow himself to experience his natural emotions. Wherever he had to stop writing his account of the event, he was asked to draw a line. (The place where the client stops is often the location of a stuck point in the event, where the client gave up fighting, where something particularly heinous occurred, etc.) Tom was also instructed to read the account to himself every day until his next session. The therapist predicted that Tom would want to avoid writing the account and procrastinate until as late as possible. She asked Tom why it would be important for him to do the assignment and do it as soon as possible.  This was a technique to determine how much Tom was able to recount the rationale for the therapy, and to strengthen his resolve to overcome avoidance. Tom responded that he needed to stop avoiding, or he would remain scared of his memory. The therapist added that the assignment was to help Tom get his full memory back, to feel his emotions about it, and for therapist and client to begin to look for stuck points. She also reassured Tom that although doing so could be difficult for a relatively brief period of time, it would not continue to be so intense, and he would soon be over the hardest part of the therapy.  Session 4  During the settling-in portion of the session, Tom indicated that he had written the account of the event the evening before, although he had thought about and dreaded it every day prior to that. He admitted that he had been avoidant due to his anxiety. The therapist asked Tom to read his account aloud to her. Before starting, Tom asked why it was important to read it in the session. The therapist reminded Tom of what they had talked about the previous session, and added that the act of reading aloud would help him to access the whole memory and his feelings about it. Tom read what he wrote quickly, like a police report, and without much feeling:  There were several of us who were assigned to guard a checkpoint south of Baghdad. We were there because insurgents were beginning to take over the particular area, and we were there to contain the area. I was placed on top of the checkpoint. It was dusk. It had been a fairly routine day, with people coming through the checkpoint like they were going through a toll booth. Off in the distance I noticed a small, dark car that was going faster than most cars. I could tell it was going faster because there was more sand smoke kicking up behind it. Men out in front of the checkpoint were motioning for the car to slow down, but it didn’t seem to be slowing down. Someone shot into the air to warn them, but they kept on coming. I could see two heads in the car coming toward us. We had been told to shoot at any vehicle that came within 25 yards of the gate to protect those around the gate, and the area beyond the gate. The car kept coming. I shot a bunch of rounds at the car.  At least one other person shot, too. There was so much chaos after that. I remember feeling my gun in my hand as I stood there. After a few moments, I also remember my legs carrying me down to the car. I don’t really remember how I got there, but I did. Several men   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  had surrounded the car, and a man got out of it. The man was crying. No, sobbing. He was speaking fast while he cried. He turned toward the car, resisting the men who attempted to remove him from the scene. I turned to see what the man was looking at and saw them for the first time. I saw the woman first.  There was blood everywhere, and her face had been shot. Then I saw the little girl in the backseat slumped over, holding a doll. There was blood all over her, too. I saw the gunshots through the car. I looked back at the woman, but avoided looking at her face. I saw a bump under her dress. She was pregnant.  I don’t remember much else after that. I know I went back to camp and basically fell apart. They took me off duty for a couple of days, but eventually they sent me back to the Forward Operating Base because I was such a mess.  After reading the account, Tom quickly placed it in his binder of materials and closed the binder as if to indicate that he was ready to move onto something else. The therapist asked Tom what he was feeling, and he indicated that he was feeling “nothing.” The therapist followed up, saying, “Nothing at all?” Tom reluctantly admitted that he was feeling anxious. The therapist then asked him to read the account again, but this time to slow down his reading rate, and allow himself to experience the emotions he had felt at the time of the event.  After reading the account for the second time, the therapist sought to flush out details of the event that Tom had “glossed over” and to focus on what appeared to be the most difficult aspects of the situation.  tHeraPist: What part of what you just read to me is the most difficult? tom: It is all difficult. The whole thing is horrible.  tHeraPist: What is the worst of it, though?  tom: I guess the worst of it is seeing that small girl in the backseat of the car.  tHeraPist: What did she look like when you saw her?  (Tom describes his memory of the girl when he arrived at the car.)  tHeraPist: What are you feeling right now?  tom: I feel sick to my stomach. I feel like I did at the time—that I want to throw up. I am also disgusted and sad. I killed an innocent child. There are so many things I could have done differently not to have taken her life.  (The therapist is aware of the assimilation process in Tom’s use of hindsight bias. She stores that information away for future reference because she wants to make sure that Tom is feeling strongly as many of his natural emotions as possible about the traumatic event.)  tHeraPist: Continue to feel those feelings. Don’t run  away from them. Anything else that you’re feeling? tom: I feel mad at myself and guilty.  tHeraPist: Were you feeling mad at yourself and  guilty at the time? tom: No. I was horrified.  tHeraPist: OK, let’s stay with that feeling.  tom: (Pauses.) I don’t want to feel this anymore. tHeraPist: I know you don’t want to feel this anymore.  You’re doing a great job of not avoiding your feelings  here. In order to not feel like this for a long time,  you need to feel these absolutely natural feelings. Let  them run their course. They’ll decrease if you stay  with them.  After a period in which Tom experienced his feelings related to the situation and allowed them to dissipate, a discussion ensued regarding how hurtful it was to Tom to hear other people’s reaction to the war. He expressed specific frustration with the presidential administration and its policy on the war. The therapist gently redirected Tom’s more philosophical discussion of international policy to the effects of the trauma on him. Tom then told a story of how he had shared his traumatic experience with a high school friend. He felt that this person had a negative reaction to him as a result of sharing the story. Tom felt judged and unsupported by this friend. Since this experience with his friend, Tom had refrained from telling others about his combat experience. Using Socratic questioning, the therapist asked Tom if there might be any reason, outside of his actions, that someone might have a negative reaction to hearing about the shooting. Through this exchange, Tom was able to recognize that when others hear about traumatic events, they also are trying to make sense of these experiences in light of their existing belief systems. In other words, others around him might fall prey to the “just world” belief that bad things only happen to bad people. They also might not take into account the entire context in which Tom shot the passengers in the car. This recognition resulted in Tom feeling less angry at his friend for this perceived judgment. He was also somewhat willing to admit that his interpretation   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  of his friend’s reaction might have been skewed by his own judgment of himself. In fact, later in the therapy, when Tom was able to ask his friend directly about the perceived reaction, the friend indicated that it had been hard for him to hear, but that he had not been judging Tom at all. In actuality, he was thinking about the terrible predicament Tom had endured at the time.  The therapist asked Tom what stuck points he had identified in writing and reading his account. The following dialogue then occurred:  tom: I’m not sure what the stuck points are, but from what you’ve been asking me, I guess you question whether or not I murdered this family.  tHeraPist: That’s true. I think it is worthwhile for us to discuss the differences between blame and responsibility. Let’s start with responsibility. From your account, it sounds like you were responsible for shooting the family. It sounds like other people may have been responsible, too, given that you were not the only person who shot at them.  (The therapist stores this fact in her mind to challenge Tom later about the appropriateness of his actions. This also provides a good opportunity to reinforce Tom for performing well in a stressful situation.)  The bottom line is that responsibility is about your behavior causing a certain outcome. Blame has to do with your intentionality to cause harm. It has to do with your motivations at the time. In this case, did you go into the situation with the motivation and intention to kill a family?  tom: No, but the outcome was that they were murdered.  tHeraPist: Some died. From what you’ve shared, if we put ourselves back into the situation at the time, it was not at all your intention for them to die. They were coming down the road too fast, not responding to the very clear efforts to warn them to stop. Your own and others’ intentions were to get them to stop at the checkpoint. Your intention at the time did not seem to be to kill them. In fact, wasn’t your intention quite the opposite?  tom: Yes. (Begins to cry.)  tHeraPist: (Pauses until Tom’s crying subsides somewhat.) It doesn’t seem that your intention was to kill them at all. Thus, the word “blame” is not appropriate. Murder or considering yourself a murderer does not seem accurate in this situation. The reason I’ve questioned the term “murder” or “murderer” all  along was because it doesn’t seem like your intention was to have to shoot them.  tom: But why do I feel like I am to blame?  tHeraPist: That’s a good question. What’s your best guess about why that is?  tom: (Still crying) If someone dies, someone should take responsibility.  tHeraPist: Do you think it is possible to take responsibility without being to blame? What would be a better word for a situation that is your responsibility, but that you didn’t intend to happen? If a person shot someone but didn’t intend to do that, what would we call that?  tom: An accident, I guess.  tHeraPist: That’s right. In fact, what would you call shooting a person when you are trying to protect something or someone?  tom: Self-defense.  tHeraPist: Yes, very good. Weren’t you responsible for guarding the checkpoint?  tom: Yeah.  tHeraPist: So, if you were responsible for guarding that checkpoint, and they continued through, wouldn’t that have put the area at risk?  tom: Yes, but it was a family—not insurgents.  tHeraPist: How did you know that at the time?  tom: There was woman and child in the car.  tHeraPist: But, did you know that at the time?  tom: No.  tHeraPist: So only in hindsight do you know that it was a family that might have had no bad intention. We actually don’t know the family’s intention, do we? They didn’t heed the several warnings, right?  tom: Yes. (Pauses.) I hadn’t thought that they would be looking to do something bad with a woman and child in the car.  tHeraPist: We don’t know, and won’t ever know, bottom line. However, what we do know is what you knew at the time. What you knew at the time is that they did not heed the warnings, that you were responsible for securing the checkpoint, and that you took action when you needed to take action to protect the post. Thinking about those facts of what happened and what you knew at the time, how do you feel?   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  tom: Hmm . . . I guess I’d feel less guilty.  tHeraPist: You’d feel less guilty, or you feel less guilty? tom: When I think through it, I do feel less guilty.  tHeraPist: There may be points when you start feeling guiltier again. It will be important for you to hold onto the facts of what happened versus going to your automatic interpretation that you’ve had for awhile now. Is there any part of it that makes you proud?  tom: Proud?  tHeraPist: Yes. It seems like you did exactly what you were supposed to do in a stressful situation. Didn’t you show courage under fire?  tom: It’s hard for me to consider my killing them as courageous.  tHeraPist: Sure. You haven’t been thinking about it in this way for a long time, but it is something to consider.  The therapist’s Socratic dialogue was designed to help Tom consider the entire context in which he was operating. She also began to plant the seed that Tom not only did nothing wrong but he also did what he was supposed to do to protect the checkpoint. Whenever possible, pointing out acts of heroism or courage can be powerful interventions with trauma survivors.  Prior to ending the session, the therapist checked Tom’s emotional state to make sure he was calmer than he had been during the session. She also inquired about his reaction to the therapy session. He commented that it had been very difficult, but that he felt better than he expected in going into the “nitty-gritty” of what happened. He also noted that there were things he had not considered about the event that were “food for thought.” The therapist praised Tom for doing a great job on the writing assignment and reinforced the importance of not quitting now. She commented that he had completed one of the hardest steps of the therapy, which would help him recover.  The therapist took the first account of the trauma and gave Tom his next practice assignment: to write the entire account again. The therapist asked Tom to add any details he might have left out of the first account and to provide even more sensory details. She also asked him to record any thoughts and feelings he was having in the here-and-now in parentheses, along with his thoughts and feelings at the time of the event.  Session 5  Tom arrived at Session 5 looking brighter and making more eye contact with the therapist. He indicated that he had written the account again, right after the previous session. He commented that the writing was hard, but not as hard as the first time. The therapist used this as an opportunity to reinforce how natural emotions resolve naturally as they are allowed expression. Tom noted that he had talked with his wife more this week, avoiding her less. Their increased communication allowed Tom’s wife to express her concerns about Tom’s well-being. She shared that he seemed disinterested in her and in their unborn child. Tom had previously told his wife about the incident, but he had not shared the specific detail that the woman in the vehicle was pregnant. Tom perceived his wife as having a very good reaction to his disclosure about the pregnant woman. He noted that she asked him questions, and that her comments indicated that she did not blame him for his actions. For example, she asked, “How could you have known at the time that it was a family?” She also reportedly said, “It’s hard to know with terrorism if they were actually just a family traveling.” Tom laughed when he reported that their conversation sounded like his last psychotherapy session.  The therapist asked Tom to read his second account out loud, with as many emotions as possible. Tom had written more about the event, and the therapist noted that he had included more information about what he and the other guards had done to warn the passengers in the car to slow down for the checkpoint. Tom read the second account more slowly and was not as tense as he had been the first time he read aloud. Tom’s second account included much more detail and focused more on the vehicle and its occupants after he had fired upon them.  tHeraPist: I notice that you wrote more about the car  and the family. What are you feeling about that right  now? tom: I feel sad. tHeraPist: Do you feel as sad as you felt the first time  you wrote about it? tom: I think I may feel sadder about it now. tHeraPist: Hmm . . . Why do you think that might be? tom: I think it’s like what I wrote in the parenthesis  about what I’m thinking now. Now, instead of feeling   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  so much guilt that I shot them, I think it’s sad that they didn’t heed the warnings.  tHeraPist: You mentioned that you’re feeling less guilt now. Why is that?  tom: I’m beginning to realize that I was not the only one there that was trying to stop them. Several of us were trying to get them to stop. There is still some guilt that I was the one who shot them.  tHeraPist: If one of the other guards had shot them, would you blame him or her for the shooting? Would you expect him or her to feel guilty for their behavior?   tom: (Laughs.) I started thinking about that this week. It made me wonder if it was really me who even shot them. As I was writing and thinking about it more, I realized that there is a possibility that another of the guards may have been shooting at the same time.  tHeraPist: What would it mean if he or she was shooting at the same time?  tom: If he was shooting at the same time, it means that he thought that shooting at them might be the right thing to do in that situation.  tHeraPist: Might have been the right thing to do?  tom: (smiling) Yeah, I still have questions that we might have been able to do something else.  tHeraPist: It seems like you’re still trying to “undo” what happened. I’m curious, what else could you have done?  tom: Not have shot at them.  tHeraPist: Then what would have happened?  tom: They might have stopped. (Pauses.) Or I guess they could have gone through the checkpoint and hurt other people past the checkpoint. I guess they could have also been equipped with a car bomb that could have hurt many other people. That seems hard to believe, though, because of the woman and child in the car.  tHeraPist: It is impossible for us to know their intentions, as we discussed before. The bottom line is that you’ve tended to assume that doing something different, or doing nothing, would have led to a better outcome.  tom: That is true. I still feel sad.  tHeraPist: Sure you do—that’s natural. I take it as a good sign that you feel sad. Sadness seems like a very  natural and appropriate reaction to what happened— much more consistent with what happened than the guilt and self-blame that you’ve been experiencing.  Tom and the therapist discussed how the goal of the therapy was not to forget what had happened, but to have the memory without all of the anxiety, guilt, and other negative emotions attached to it. Tom indicated that he was becoming less afraid and more able to tolerate his feelings, even when they were intense. Tom acknowledged that reading his account, talking about his trauma, and coming to psychotherapy sessions were becoming easier and that his negative feelings were beginning to diminish.  After discussing Tom’s reactions to his memories, with a focus on how he had attempted to assimilate the memory into his existing beliefs, the therapist began to discuss areas of overaccommodation. One area of overaccommodation was Tom’s beliefs about the U.S. military. He had entered the service with a very positive view of the military. Tom had a family history of military service and believed in service to country and the “rightfulness” of the military.  Subsequent to his traumatic event and military service in Iraq, he developed a negative view of the military that had extended to the Federal government in general. The therapist used this content to introduce the first series of tools to help challenge Tom’s stuck points. She also emphasized how he would gradually be taking over as his own therapist, capable of challenging his own patterns of thinking that kept him “stuck.”  tHeraPist: It seems that you have some very strong beliefs about the military and the U.S. government since your service. I’d like to use those beliefs to introduce some new material that will be helpful to you in starting to challenge stuck points on your own. You’ve done an outstanding job of considering the way that you think and feel about things. You’ve been very open to considering alternative interpretations of things. Starting in this session, I’m going to help you to become your own therapist and to attack your own stuck points directly.  tom: OK. tHeraPist: Today we will cover the first set of skills. We’re going to be building your skills over the next few sessions. The first tool is a sheet called the Challenging Questions Sheet. Our first step is to identify a single belief you have that may be a stuck point.   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  As I mentioned before, I’d like us to use your beliefs about the Federal government now. So, if you were to boil down what you believe about the Federal government or the military, what is it?  tom: I don’t know. I’m not sure. I guess I’d say that the  U.S. military is extremely corrupt. tHeraPist: Good. That is very clear and to the point. So let’s go over these questions and answer them as they relate to this belief. The first question you ask yourself is, “What’s the evidence for and against this idea?” tom: The evidence for this is Abu Ghraib. Can you believe that they would do that? I would have also put my own shooting under the “for” list, but I’m beginning to question that. tHeraPist: What other evidence is there of corruption? tom: Oh, and these defense contractors . . . what a scam! That leads me to the current administration and its vested interests in going to war to make money on defense contracting. And, oh, of course, to make money on the oil coming out of these countries!   tHeraPist: OK. Sounds like you have some “for” evidence. What about the “against” evidence?  tom: Well, some of my fellow soldiers were very good. They were very committed in their service and to the mission. I also had mostly good leaders, although some of them were real pigs. Some were really power-hungry a—holes, frankly.  tHeraPist: So, it sounds like you have some pros and cons that support your belief that the U.S. military is completely corrupt. In the process of changing, it is not uncommon to have thoughts on both sides. That is great news! It means that you are considering different alternatives, and are not “stuck” on one way of seeing things. Let’s take the next one. . . .  The therapist spent the balance of the session going over the list of questions to make sure that Tom understood them. Although most of the questions focused on the issue of corruption in the military, other issues were also brought in to illustrate the meaning of the questions. For example, the therapist introduced the probability questions with the example from Tom’s life in which he believed that he was going to be shot by an insurgent sniper while back home. These questions are best illustrated with regard to issues of safety. The  therapist pointed out that perhaps not all of the questions applied to the belief on which Tom was working. The question “Are you thinking in all-or-none terms?” seemed to resonate with Tom the most because it applied to his belief about the military. He commented that he was applying a few examples of what seemed to be corruption to the entire military. Tom also indicated that his description of the military as “extremely” corrupt was consistent with the question “Are you using words or phrases that are extreme or exaggerated?” Indicative of his grasp of the worksheet, Tom also noticed that the question “Are you taking selected examples out of context?” applied to his prior view of his behavior as a murder in the traumatic event.  For his practice assignment prior to Session 6, Tom agreed to complete one Challenging Questions Sheet each day. He and the therapist brainstormed about potential stuck points prior to the end of the session to facilitate practice assignment completion. These stuck points included “I don’t deserve to have a family,” “I murdered an innocent family,” and “I am weak because I have PTSD.”
