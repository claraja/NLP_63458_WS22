Health anxiety

Health anxiety is when you spend so much time worrying you're ill, or about getting ill, that it starts to take over your life. It's related to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Check if you have health anxiety

You may have health anxiety if you:

    constantly worry about your health
    frequently check your body for signs of illness, such as lumps, tingling or pain
    are always asking people for reassurance that you're not ill
    worry that a doctor or medical tests may have missed something
    obsessively look at health information on the internet or in the media
    avoid anything to do with serious illness, such as medical TV programmes
    act as if you were ill (for example, avoiding physical activities)

Anxiety itself can cause symptoms like headaches or a racing heartbeat, and you may mistake these for signs of illness.
Self-help for health anxiety
Keep a diary

    note how often you check your body, ask people for reassurance, or look at health information
    try to gradually reduce how often you do these things over a week

Challenge your thoughts

    draw a table with 2 columns
    write your health worries in the 1st column, then more balanced thoughts in the 2nd. For example, in the 1st column you may write, "I'm worried about these headaches" and in the 2nd, "Headaches can often be a sign of stress"

Keep busy with other things

    when you get the urge to check your body, for example, distract yourself by going for a walk or calling a friend

Get back to normal activities

    try to gradually start doing things you've been avoiding because of your health worries, such as sports or socialising

Try to relax
