Generalized Anxiety Disorder  quality of life (Hoffman, Dukes, & Wittchen, 2008). Furthermore, individuals with GAD have more annual medical visits than other patients (Belanger, Ladouceur, & Morin, 2005) and are more likely to seek medical, rather than mental health, care for their symptoms (Wang et al., 2005). In fact, GAD is the most common anxiety disorder found among primary care patients (Ballenger et al., 2001), and the mean annual medical cost of GAD is $2,138 higher than for other anxiety disorders (mean = $6,475; Revicki et al., 2012). Given that GAD is associated with a host of physical complaints and conditions, including painful physical symptoms (Romera et al., 2010), gastrointestinal symptoms (Mussell et al., 2008), and cardiological complaints (Logue, Thomas, Barbee, & Hoehn-Saric, 1993), it is not surprising that patients with GAD have a tendency to overutilize medical (Ballenger et al., 2001), and underutilize psychiatric (Kennedy & Schwab, 1997) services.  Although earlier diagnostic criteria for GAD incorporated symptoms of autonomic arousal (e.g., accelerated heart rate), several lines of research converged to support removal of these criteria for DSM-IV. A largescale study of reported associated symptoms indicated that autonomic symptoms were more rarely endorsed than symptoms of muscle tension, vigilance, and scanning, such as those described earlier (Marten et al., 1993). Furthermore, physiological studies revealed that GAD was more accurately characterized by reduced heart rate variability than by increased autonomic arousal (e.g., Thayer, Friedman, & Borkovec, 1996). Finally, experimental studies of worry revealed that worrying prior to exposure to a feared stimulus leads to less autonomic arousal than relaxation prior to exposure to a feared stimulus (e.g., Borkovec & Hu, 1990). Taken together, these studies suggest that autonomic arousal is not a necessary feature of GAD.  Instead, the central defining feature of GAD is excessive worry, or repeatedly thinking about worst case scenarios involving potential future events. Studies reveal that worry content does not differ between individuals who meet criteria for GAD and those who do not, except that those with GAD report worrying about miscellaneous topics, particularly minor matters, more than those who do not meet criteria (e.g., Roemer, Molina, & Borkovec, 1997). As noted earlier, individuals with GAD report difficulty stopping their worry once it starts, and clients often note that worrying about one topic can lead to worry about another. These findings and observations suggest that worry is a cognitive habit, with clients who meet criteria for GAD getting “stuck”  in cycles of worry about a wide range of topics that are difficult to stop once started. All cognitive-behavioral treatments for GAD emphasize interrupting this cycle, although methods for doing so vary.  Descriptive studies of GAD and worry have revealed affective, cognitive, and interpersonal correlates that may have important treatment implications. Borkovec’s seminal research revealed that worry serves an avoidant function, by its perceived association with decreasing the likelihood of already low base rate negative events, and by the reduction in physiological arousal noted earlier (Borkovec, Alcaine, & Behar, 2004), as well as distraction from more emotional topics by selfreport (Borkovec & Roemer, 1995). Mennin and others have demonstrated that GAD is associated with both self-reported deficits in emotion regulation (e.g., Mennin, Holaway, Fresco, Moore, & Heimberg, 2007) and limits in implicit regulation of emotional processing (Etkin & Schatzberg, 2011). Studies in this area have also revealed that GAD is associated with the fear or distress of anxiety (and other emotions; Lee, Orsillo, Roemer, & Allen, 2010; Mennin et al., 2007), worry about worry (or metaworry; Wells, 2005), and habitual avoidance of internal experiences (i.e., experiential avoidance; Lee et al., 2010). Furthermore, in a clinical sample, both worry and GAD were uniquely associated with perceived uncontrollability of emotional reactions, beyond shared variance with other known cognitive predictors of GAD (Stapinski, Abbott, & Rapee, 2010). Extensive research also documents an association between GAD and intolerance of uncertainty (the tendency to respond negatively to uncertain events and situations; Gentes & Ruscio, 2011), including an experimental study showing that manipulated uncertainty leads to increased worry (Ladouceur, Gosselin, & Dugas, 2000). GAD is also associated with interpersonal problems (Przeworski et al., 2011), including increased marital distress (Whisman, 2007).  overview of eviDeNce for Psychosocial treatMeNts of GaD  Meta-analyses reveal that cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) are efficacious for GAD, with large effect sizes that are maintained over follow-up periods (Borkovec & Ruscio, 2001; Covin, Ouimet, Seeds, & Dozois, 2008), and evidence of comparative efficacy over nondirective therapy (Borkovec & Costello, 1993). Within CBTs, a meta-analysis revealed comparable effects   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  of cognitive therapy and relaxation therapy in treating GAD (Siev & Chambless, 2007). However, GAD remains one of the least successfully treated of the anxiety disorders (Waters & Craske, 2005), with most studies indicating that fewer than 65% of clients meet criteria for high end-state functioning at posttreatment (Ladouceur et al., 2000; Newman et al., 2011).  As briefly reviewed earlier, recent research has refined and expanded our understanding of GAD in an effort to identify causal and maintaining factors to target in therapy and improve its efficacy (see Behar, DiMarco, Hekler, Mohlman, & Staples, 2009, for an extensive review). Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) informed by these models indicate that targeting the interpersonal and emotion-focused aspects of GAD (Newman et al., 2011), and intolerance of uncertainty (Dugas et al., 2010), yield effects comparable to existing CBTs for GAD. A small pilot study found that targeting metacognition (e.g., metaworry) in GAD (Wells et al., 2010) produced better outcomes than applied relaxation; however, the very low rates of response to applied relaxation, coupled with the small sample size, indicate a need for further research to confirm this finding. A trial examining the efficacy of emotion regulation therapy for GAD is currently under way (Mennin & Fresco, in press).  We developed the acceptance-based behavioral therapy described in this chapter (which explicitly targets reactivity to [distress about] internal experiences, and experiential and behavioral avoidance, as described below) in an effort to better target GAD and comorbid disorders. We use the term “acceptance-based behavior therapy” (ABBT; Roemer & Orsillo, 2009) to refer to the broad class of therapies based in cognitivebehavioral theory but that explicitly incorporate methods to promote acceptance of internal experiences (e.g., acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2012]; dialectical behavior therapy [DBT; Linehan, 1993]; mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002]). This ABBT for GAD, which draws from these treatments, as well as Borkovec’s CBT for GAD (Borkovec & Sharpless, 2004), has been examined through an open trial and two RCTs. The open trial revealed significant, large effects on clinician-rated GAD severity, self-reported worry, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (Roemer & Orsillo, 2007). A wait-list RCT similarly revealed significant, large effects on clinician and selfreported GAD symptoms, as well as depressive symptoms (Roemer, Orsillo, & Salters-Pedneault, 2008).  Marginally significant, medium effects emerged on clinician-rated additional diagnoses and self-reported quality of life. Significant large effects also emerged on self-reported experiential avoidance and mindfulness, two proposed mechanisms of change in the treatment. All effects were maintained at 9-month follow-up. Of those treated, 77% met criteria for high end-state functioning (falling within normative range on the majority of anxiety measures) at posttreatment; this proportion increased slightly (nonsignificantly) over time. In this trial, ABBT produced a significant increase in engagement in valued, or personally meaningful, activities (Michelson, Lee, Orsillo, & Roemer, 2011). Moreover, ABBT significantly impacted outcome variables proposed in other models to be central to GAD (emotion regulation deficits, intolerance of uncertainty, and perceived control over anxiety-related events; Treanor, Erisman, Salters-Pedneault, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2011). A recently completed RCT comparing ABBT with applied relaxation, an empirically treatment for GAD, revealed comparable effects on clinician-rated and self-reported GAD symptoms, clinician-rated comorbid diagnoses, and self-reported depressive symptoms and quality of life (Hayes-Skelton, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2013). A large proportion of clients in both conditions met criteria for high end-state functioning (some of the highest rates reported in the literature in each condition) and gains were maintained at 6-month follow up. Finally, there is evidence that ABBT works through its proposed mechanisms. Session-by-session changes in acceptance of internal experiences and engagement in meaningful activities predicted outcome above and beyond change in worry (Hayes, Orsillo, & Roemer, 2010).  A recent study that examined the relative efficacy of ACT compared to CBT for a mixed-anxiety sample revealed comparable effects across the full sample (Arch et al., 2012). Although the small size of the GAD subsample precluded within-subgroup analyses, examination of means suggests that ACT was effective in reducing clinician-rated and self-reported GAD symptoms in this study.  Taken together, these findings suggest that psychosocial treatments for GAD are efficacious, and adaptations of CBT that specifically target empirically determined features of GAD are promising. As with all treatments based in behavioral theory, a well-developed case conceptualization is a necessary starting point to use evidence-based treatments effectively with a specific client.   Generalized Anxiety Disorder  aN accePtaNce‑BaseD Behavioral MoDel of GaD  An acceptance-based behavioral model of GAD is grounded in behavioral learning theory. Consistent with other theories, we propose that individuals with GAD develop the habit of worry, repeatedly anticipating potential dangers and threats. These habits are strengthened through repetition and reinforcing consequences. This worry process is negatively reinforced by both the nonoccurrence of feared outcomes and the reduced physiological activation that is a positive consequence of engaging in worry (Borkovec et al., 2004).  Moreover, individuals with GAD come to associate universal, functional human states such as fear, anxiety, other emotional responses, and even worry with negative personal characteristics. As a result, individuals with GAD respond to anxiety-related thoughts and emotional states with self-criticism and judgment. In an attempt to avoid or escape the uncomfortable, unwanted experience of worry, and the associated negative self-evaluation, individuals with GAD engage in a variety of potentially problematic behaviors. Although these behaviors interfere with quality of life, they provide short-term relief from arousal and negative affect.  Drawing from decades of research on GAD, other anxiety disorders, and broader models of psychopathology (e.g., Hayes et al., 2012), we hypothesize that the following three learned behaviors contribute to the development and maintenance of GAD.  Reacting to Internal Experiences with Distress, Criticism, and Judgment (Leading to Entanglement/Fusion)  One of the most formative, consistent findings to emerge in the field of anxiety disorders has been that the experience of anxiety or fear in and of itself (e.g., sensations of panic, worrisome thoughts, catastrophic images, recurrent painful memories) is not evidence of a disorder. Instead, reactions to these symptoms, or “reaction to our reactions” (Borkovec & Sharpless, 2004) exacerbate their intensity and duration, cause distress, and interfere with quality of life, leading to the anxiety disorder diagnosis. The centrality of “reactions to reactions” to the concept of psychological disorders was recently documented in a treatment trial. Changes in reactivity to emotions predicted unique variance in all outcome variables over and above changes in frequency of emotional responses in a study of the unified proto   col for emotional disorders (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2012; see Payne, Ellard, Farchione, Fairholme, & Barlow, Chapter 6, this volume).  A growing body of research documents that individuals with GAD report increased anxiety sensitivity (i.e., fear of anxiety-related bodily sensations; Olatunji & Wolitzky-Taylor, 2009), negative reactivity to their emotional responses (e.g., Lee et al., 2010; Mennin et al., 2007), and worry about their own worry (Wells, 2005). Furthermore, anxiety leads to a narrowed focus of attention (both external and internal) toward potential threat (Cisler & Koster, 2010), which likely both exacerbates these reactions and is strengthened by reactivity, further perpetuating cycles of anxious responding. These reactions can lead individuals to become entangled with (Germer, 2005) or “hooked” on (Chodron, 2007) their experiences of anxiety and worry, so that the anxiety comes to seem self-defining and allencompassing. Instead of viewing anxiety as a response that is elicited in a particular context, individuals can come to define themselves as “anxious,” fusing their identity with these experiences (e.g., Hayes et al., 2012). Thus, negative reactivity to emotions can evolve into negative personal judgments (“I’m so weak!”; “Other people don’t worry the way I do”), which in turn can increase anxiety and worry.  Becoming entangled or fused with internal experiences makes it much harder to see the ways that thoughts, feelings, and sensations naturally rise, fall, and change over time. It can also interfere with one’s ability to understand and respond effectively to emotional states, leading to diffuse experiences of distress that do not provide clear motivational information. When fear, anxiety, and worry are perceived as distressing, defining, and unrelenting, they naturally elicit attempts to escape and avoid.  Rigid Attempts to Avoid Internal Distress  Trying not to think about or feel or remember something distressing is a natural response.  All people use strategies to turn their attention away from internal distress at times, in order to bring attention to the task at hand. Yet experimental studies show that rigid, repeated efforts to put thoughts, feelings, sensations or memories out of our minds (e.g., experiential avoidance; Hayes, Wilson, Gifford, Follette, & Strosahl, 1996) are often unsuccessful and can actually increase distressing thoughts, feelings, or sensations (e.g., Gross, 2002; Levitt, Brown, Orsillo, & Barlow,   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  2004; Najmi & Wegner, 2008). Furthermore, instructed effort not to think of situations can increase reported anxiety associated with the target situation (Roemer & Borkovec, 1994), suggesting that experiential avoidance increases distress about thoughts and emotions. Taken together, these studies suggest that rigid efforts to avoid distressing thoughts, feelings, sensations, and memories can increase the frequency of these experiences, as well as the distress associated with them, further strengthening the cycle of reactivity and avoidance. Efforts at experiential avoidance are likely to reduce distress in the short term at least sometimes, leading to immediate negative reinforcement, further strengthening this habitual response.  Reports of experiential avoidance are associated with GAD diagnoses, even beyond shared variance with depressive symptoms (Lee et al., 2010). Furthermore, as described earlier, experimental studies demonstrate that worry itself serves an experientially avoidant function by reducing physiological arousal in response to feared stimuli and distracting individuals from more distressing topics (Borkovec et al., 2004).  Behavioral Avoidance/Constriction  Reactions to internal experiences and rigid experiential avoidance not only feed on each other in a continually escalating cycle, but also naturally lead to avoidance of contexts that elicit anxiety or other experiences of distress. Behavioral avoidance is a core feature of other anxiety disorders, but it has generally been overlooked in GAD. However, individuals with GAD often avoid certain situations, spend extensive time preparing for situations, procrastinate or put off decision making, or seek reassurance, all in an effort to avoid distress, anxiety, and/or uncertainty (Andrews et al., 2010). Clients with GAD report engaging in valued actions (i.e., doing what they find personally meaningful) less than do control participants (Michelson et al., 2011).  Clinically, clients with GAD show a range of avoidance behaviors. Sometimes avoidance is overt, such as when a client does not pursue dating or a promotion at work due to anxiety, fears of being rejected, or worry. Other times, clients who seem to be engaging in a wide range of behaviors that are important (e.g., taking on challenges at work, being involved in activities with their children) may report that they are constantly worrying about what is ahead rather than attending to what they are doing in the moment. Borkovec notes this  focus on the future instead of the present as a core characteristic of GAD (e.g., Borkovec & Sharpless, 2004), and research indicates that GAD and worry are associated with reports of reduced mindfulness (awareness in the present moment; Roemer et al., 2009). This continual focus on what might go wrong in the future can lead clients to feel like spectators in their own lives: behaviorally, but not emotionally, engaged in actions that matter to them.  This conceptual model highlights three targets for intervention when treating clients with GAD and other comorbid disorders: (1) problematic ways of relating to internal experiences, (2) rigid strategies aimed at experiential avoidance, and (3) constriction or avoidance of meaningful actions. Based on this model, the goals of an ABBT for GAD are (1) to cultivate an expanded (as opposed to narrowed) awareness and a compassionate (as opposed to critical and judgmental), decentered (as opposed to entangled and fused) stance toward internal experiences; (2) to increase acceptance of/willingness to have internal experiences; and (3) to engage mindfully in personally meaningful behaviors.  aPPlyiNG aBBt  Context for Therapy  Our first case study of ABBT took place in group format (Orsillo, Roemer, & Barlow, 2003). Although clients benefited from the group context in some ways, they reported that they wanted more individualized focus to help them clarify their values (i.e., what matters to them) and apply the treatment to their specific contexts. As a result, all of our subsequent trials have used individual therapy. However, we think that the modality of treatment can be adjusted to better fit specific settings. In fact, a recent study found that a group version of our protocol led to significant reductions in self-reported anxiety, worry, and GAD symptoms in a community setting (Heatherington et al., 2013). Furthermore, several elements of ABBT (e.g., psychoeducation, mindfulness practice, commitment to valued action) have been effectively conducted in group settings in other, related treatment approaches (e.g., Evans et al., 2008; Kocovski, Fleming, & Rector, 2009).  Given the prevalence of GAD in primary care contexts, we are interested in adapting treatment so it can be used as part of integrative primary care. We wrote   Generalized Anxiety Disorder  a self-help book that may be beneficial in this context (Orsillo & Roemer, 2011), but no studies to date have examined its effectiveness. Briefer workshops (e.g., Blevins, Roca, & Spencer, 2011; Brown et al., 2011) may also be a useful modality for delivery of the conceptual model and suggestions for mindfulness and valued action practices in contexts where individual therapy is less feasible due to economic or time constraints.  Therapist Characteristics  A central aspect of ABBT involves modeling acceptance of intense emotional experiences. Therefore, successful ABBT therapists are able to tolerate intense emotions and convey acceptance to their clients. Similarly, ABBT therapists continually validate and express compassion toward clients in distress, providing for clients an example of how they might respond differently to their own experiences and reduce the cycle of reactivity and avoidance that contributes to maintenance of their symptoms. These characteristics, combined with a clear understanding of the model and how to apply it to specific cases, help therapists to develop a strong, positive working alliance, which significantly predicted outcome in our most recent trial (Sorenson, Hayes- Skelton, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2012).  As we describe more fully below, ABBT is meant to be applied flexibly, with therapists adapting their approach, strategies used, and between-session assignments to meet the presentation and context of clients. As such, flexibility may be an important therapist characteristic. In a small qualitative study, as part of our most recent RCT, we interviewed clients who identified with marginalized backgrounds in terms of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or religion. Clients identified the flexibility of their therapist as an important factor in how helpful they found treatment and how well it fit with their particular context (Fuchs et al., 2012).  Client Characteristics  In the studies we have conducted on ABBT for GAD, we have had very few exclusion criteria in order to maximize the generalizability of our findings. Clients frequently present with comorbid diagnoses, most commonly major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and other anxiety disorders. Because ABBT targets mechanisms that are likely to underlie these  other disorders as well, treatment may positively impact these comorbid conditions (e.g., Roemer et al., 2008). However, outside the constraints of protocol therapy, we would recommend integrating elements of evidence-based methods (e.g., behavioral activation, exposure) when indicated. The disorders we have ruled out in our RCTs, primarily because they warrant specific treatments, include substance dependence, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders. Thus, we cannot determine the impact of ABBT on these comorbid presentations.  To date, we have only preliminarily explored potential predictors of response to ABBT. To date, our data suggest that gender, age, GAD severity, frequency and intensity of worry, depressive symptoms, and comorbid diagnoses do not significantly predict outcome (Orsillo, Roemer, & Salters-Pedneault, 2008).  As with most evidence-based treatments, considerably more research is needed to determine the ways an ABBT for GAD might be beneficial for people from marginalized or nondominant cultural backgrounds. A meta-analysis indicated promising results for ABBTs more broadly (Fuchs, Lee, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2013). Our small qualitative study revealed that clients from marginalized backgrounds generally found ABBT helpful (Fuchs et al., 2012). Clients particularly noted that therapist flexibility and the focus on valued living helped them engage in treatment and find it relevant. However, some clients reported that therapist inflexibility or not connecting to specific mindfulness exercises was a barrier.  A commonly expressed concern is that mindfulness may not be accepted by clients who identify strongly with a non-Buddhist religion. However, mindfulness exercises can be adapted to match specific religious practices (Sobczak & West, 2013) because mindfulness is part of many religious traditions, for instance, Western Christian contemplative practice (Dimidjian & Linehan, 2009). More work is needed to explore how best to adapt ABBT for clients from different backgrounds, and also how to use ABBT strategies to address contextual sources of stress such as discrimination and lack of resources (Lee, Fuchs, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2009; Sobczak & West, 2013).  Concurrent Pharmacological Treatment  Although medication is the most common mode of treatment for GAD (Issakidis, Sanderson, Corry, An    CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  drews, & Lapsley, 2004) and is often considered a first-line treatment option (Katzman, 2009), evidence for the sustained clinical impact of pharmacotherapy is limited (Davidson, Bose, Korotzer, & Zheng, 2004; Gelenberg et al., 2000; Rickels et al., 2003). The magnitude of change in GAD symptoms associated with pharmacological treatment ranges from moderate to poor (Hidalgo, Tupler, & Davidson, 2007). Moreover, pharmacological interventions may produce adverse side effects (Katzman, 2009) and are less cost-effective than psychotherapeutic approaches such as CBT (Heuzenroeder et al., 2004).  Clients who were stable on medications were enrolled in our clinical trials. Within ABBT, medications are conceptualized as one of several ways to reduce the intensity of internal reactions, so that it is easier to accept them, have compassion for oneself, and engage in meaningful actions. In this way, a nonexperientially avoidant function for medication can be highlighted (medication helps one to engage more fully in life and accept whatever comes), so that it is consistent with the rest of treatment.  Overview of Treatment Elements  In our clinical trials, we have followed a 16-session, weekly individual protocol for ABBT, with the last two sessions tapered (every other week) and focused on relapse prevention. The first seven sessions focus on psychoeducation and skills building, while the remaining sessions focus on application of skills while the client engages in personally meaningful, valued actions. Here we provide a brief overview of each element of treatment, followed by a composite case example to illustrate the way each element is addressed across the course of therapy. Those interested in more details on our approach should consult our book for therapists (Roemer & Orsillo, 2009) and our self-help book (Orsillo & Roemer, 2011).  Clinical Assessment to Develop an Acceptance-Based Behavioral Conceptualization  To develop a case conceptualization that guides flexible application of treatment elements, we assess symptoms, context, and the three components of the model.  syMPToMs  Assessing the client’s anxiety and related symptoms provides useful information about targets for change,  while also supporting the therapeutic goal of changing a client’s relationship with anxiety. Assessment of anxiety-related thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and behaviors, the contexts in which anxiety typically occurs, and the frequency and severity of symptoms helps clients begin to observe more accurately specific elements of their anxiety responses. Ongoing self-monitoring of daily anxiety symptoms, as well as guided imaginal recall, can provide a more accurate assessment of specific symptoms than general report given that clients who engage in habitual avoidance or suppression of their anxiety often do not have an accurate perception of its frequency, duration, or variability over time. Brief but specific self-report measures (e.g., the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995, or the trait and weekly Penn State Worry Questionnaires (Meyer, Miller, Metzger, & Borkovec, 1990; Stöber & Bittencourt, 1998), can also be used, both to obtain baseline measures of symptoms and to track weekly fluctuations in symptoms.  Semistructured clinical interviews such as the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (Di Nardo et al., 1994) can be used to determine both principal and comorbid disorders to guide the selection and emphasis of specific treatment strategies. Depression is an important target of assessment, as are other clinical presentations, such as eating disorders and substance-use disorders, which may indicate specific avoidance strategies that need to be targeted in treatment.  reACTions To inTernAl exPerienCes  Assessing how clients respond to their anxiety symptoms, as well as to internal experiences (e.g., thoughts, emotions, sensations, memories) more generally, contributes to case conceptualization. Therapists may ask questions such as “When you notice you are worrying, what thoughts, feelings and sensations do you experience next?”; “Do you find yourself having critical thoughts about your experiences of anxiety?”; and “What kinds of thoughts do you have?” or use selfreport measures that capture these constructs. Selfcriticism, judgment, and reactivity that arise for clients in response to their own thoughts and feelings are important targets for intervention. Measures such as the Affective Control Scale (Williams, Chambless, & Ahrens, 1997), a measure of distress in response to anxiety, depression, anger, and positive emotions, and the Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) can help to identify reactivity to emotions and self-criticism.   Generalized Anxiety Disorder  exPerienTiAl AVoiDAnCe  Therapists also assess the strategies that clients use in an attempt to suppress, avoid, or change internal experiences (Hayes et al., 1996). Experiential avoidance strategies may be internal, such as thought or emotion suppression (Gross & Levenson, 1997; Najmi & Wegner, 2008), or external, such as using substances, engaging in self-harm, or restricting eating. Therapist can ask clients what they do to try to manage their distress or anxiety, then listen for avoidant strategies. Efforts in which clients engage automatically or rigidly are most likely to lead to paradoxical increases in distress and symptoms. Therapists need to distinguish between efforts to modulate or regulate emotional distress and rigid efforts to avoid it; often the difference is evident in what happens after the strategy is engaged. The former are likely to be beneficial and may be strengths on which to build in therapy, if used flexibly, whereas the latter are more likely to lead to increased distress and interference. For instance, one client with whom we worked reported going for walks to try to clear her head of worry. When her therapist asked what she did when she returned, she reported that she was more able to focus on being with her children and enjoy their time together. On the other hand, another client who described regularly watching TV in order to distract herself from her worries said that as soon as she turned off the TV, her worried thoughts flooded back, so that she found herself watching TV for hours at a time rather than doing activities she had planned during the day. Whereas the first client’s walks might be incorporated into treatment as a way to care for herself and help her engage more effectively with her children, the second client’s therapist might help her develop alternative ways of responding to her anxiety. The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (Bond et al., 2011) can help to identify experientially avoidant strategies; the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (Gratz & Roemer, 2004) assesses emotion regulation more broadly.  BeHAViorAl ConsTriCTion  Therapists should also assess how clients are functioning in their daily lives and the ways that anxiety and worry are interfering. Drawing from ACT (Wilson & Murrell, 2004), we focus particularly on the degree to which clients are doing what is important to them (i.e., what they value). We assess this with the Valued Living Questionnaire (Wilson, Sandoz, Kitchens, & Rob   erts, 2010), while also inviting clients to write about the ways anxiety interferes with their relationships, work– school–household management, self-nourishment, and community involvement. This provides not only important information about current functioning but also a target and motivation for treatment to help clients live fuller, more meaningful lives. This assessment often provides an important first step toward shifting the goal of therapy from anxiety reduction to enhancement of life.  ConTexT AnD HisTory  As with all treatment approaches, assessing the context surrounding a client is important. Therapists need to learn how the client (as well as family and friends) understands his/her anxiety, in addition to the client’s history of anxiety symptoms and other presenting problems. Therapists should also explore the client’s cultural identity, with attention to culturally specific sources of coping and strength, as well as contextual stressors that the client may face. This helps to establish rapport and validate the client’s experience, and to build the strength of the therapeutic alliance. This information also helps the therapist to ensure that therapy proceeds in a culturally sensitive and responsive way (D. W. Sue & Sue, 2012; S. Sue, 1998).  This comprehensive assessment sets the stage for treatment elements aimed at (1) cultivating an expanded (as opposed to narrowed) awareness and a compassionate (as opposed to critical and judgmental), decentered (as opposed to entangled and fused) stance toward internal experiences; (2) increasing acceptance/willingness to have internal experiences; and (3) mindfully engaging in personally meaningful behaviors.  Therapeutic Relationship  The therapeutic relationship provides an important context for therapeutic change. In ABBT, the therapist provides acceptance and compassion that allows clients to begin to react differently toward their own internal experiences. Therapists explicitly validate the humanness and naturalness of all responses clients share, emphasizing the way one’s biological makeup and learning history can easily lead to anxious responses and other emotional reactions, and the way that even apparently “irrational” thoughts can be learned from social and family influences. For instance, when a client noted in session that he knew he should not be anxious about   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  a job interview, his therapist responded that anxiety before an interview is a very natural response given that he really wants the position, and that we are hardwired to fear social rejection. This response modeled a different reaction to his anxiety and was the first step toward cultivating a new, less self-critical response.  It can be challenging to empathize with and validate some clients, particularly when they are hostile or unresponsive. Understanding the learning history and context that produces and maintains these difficult, but also in some ways functional, behaviors helps therapists cultivate compassion. When a therapist expresses genuine compassion toward a client, often the client’s reactions change, at least slightly, providing more opportunities for connection, validation, empathy, and further change.  Another challenge to the therapeutic alliance can stem from differences between client and therapist in aspects of identity (e.g., age, gender, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, immigration status, or social class; Hays, 2008; D. W. Sue & Sue, 2012). Initiating a discussion of potential differences early in therapy provides an opportunity for open communication about potential sources of misunderstanding and may make a client feel more comfortable bringing up any issues that emerge throughout the course of therapy. Therapists take responsibility for learning about a client’s cultural context on their own, while remaining sensitive to each client’s individual experiences and life contexts, so that he/she can consider how cultural and systemic factors may play a role in the client’s responses and can be used to promote growth and positive adaptation. Communicating awareness of, and sensitivity to, the therapist’s own areas of relative privilege can also contribute to a stronger therapeutic alliance.  Psychoeducation  Similar to other CBTs, psychoeducation is an important component of this ABBT. Therapists present concepts, using handouts, particularly during the first half of therapy (then revisit these concepts as needed in the second, application phase of treatment). For each concept, therapists draw examples from the client’s life (using monitoring forms, assessment material, or asking the client specifically for examples) to ensure that the material is relevant.  Psychoeducation begins with a discussion about the nature of fear, anxiety, and worry (including a discus   sion of the function of worry), followed by exploration of the function of emotions more broadly, emphasizing the habitual nature of our emotional responding and how repetition strengthens these habits, while interruption can weaken them. Therapists teach clients about the natural inclination to avoid painful or threatening cues, as well as the challenges and costs associated with trying to rigidly control internal experiences and avoid anxiety-eliciting situations. Therapists draw a distinction between clear emotions (that provide information about a response to a current context) and muddy emotions (that may be diffuse, confusing, left over, or longer lasting). Therapists also describe mindfulness skills, specifically noting the ways these skills can be used to clarify emotional responses and enhance participation in valued life activities.  Psychoeducation provides a rationale for the rest of treatment, encouraging engagement in behaviors that take significant time (e.g., mindfulness practice) or effort (e.g., engaging in valued actions). Psychoeducation can also help to promote a new relationship to internal experiences on its own. Realizing how one’s emotions become muddy and overwhelming as a result of a series of understandable processes (e.g., not getting enough sleep, still feeling upset about an earlier fight with a partner) can reduce self-criticism and judgment, which in turn can reduce muddiness and reactivity. For some clients, psychoeducation alone leads to engagement in new behaviors and to new learning that promotes accepting responses to internal experiences and increased engagement in life. However, experiential learning is often needed to supplement this clinical strategy.  Many challenges can arise when presenting psychoeducational material. First, it can be difficult to attend to specific client concerns while also presenting extensive new information. Using client examples as you teach and frequently asking clients to share their reactions can help to balance these competing demands. Also, sometimes clients disagree with material being presented. For instance, clients may insist that avoidance is an effective strategy. Arguing with clients is rarely productive, and it can weaken the therapeutic relationship. Furthermore, case conceptualizations are only a hypothesis based on the literature and clinical observation, so it is important not to cling rigidly to them. We find it useful, in this situation, to ask whether clients are willing simply to observe the concept over the next few weeks to see whether they can learn anything new about their experience. This promotes a col    Generalized Anxiety Disorder  laborative approach to treatment and helps to engage clients, while also encouraging valuable feedback on our conceptualization.  Mindfulness Skills Development  “Mindfulness” (Kabat-Zinn, 2003), or attending to the present moment with openness, curiosity, and compassion, is a central skill clients can use to change the nature of their relationship with their internal experiences (e.g., beginning to see thoughts as thoughts, or “decentering”), increase their willingness to have any reactions that arise, and promote engagement in fulfilling, meaningful lives. We use a wide range of methods to help clients bring their awareness to the present moment, and we greet their experiences with curiosity, kindness, and compassion.  self‑MoniToring  Self-monitoring is a common method used in all CBTs. Similar to these approaches, therapy begins with clients monitoring situations in which worry arises. Each week, based on what is covered in session, new aspects of experience are added (e.g., emotions, efforts to avoid experience, engagement in valued actions). The process of monitoring worry, other internal experiences, and behaviors helps to promote awareness and decentering; clients turn toward their internal experiences rather than habitually turning away, and they see each aspect of their experience rather than blending the components together (e.g., noticing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors separately). As clients begin to notice the distinction between emotion and behavior, they are more able to consider the variety of behavioral options available to them even when strong emotions arise.  Self-monitoring can be challenging for some clients. They may forget to complete monitoring forms, see them as a “homework” requirement done only at the therapist’s request, or finish them in the waiting room as opposed to completing them in the moment. Therapists can help clients to see the usefulness of the practice by clearly communicating the rationale for monitoring, underscoring that it is a skill that can be used to clarify emotions, reduce distress, and increase engagement in valued activities, and reviewing the monitoring each session and connecting observations to treatment goals. Therapists can also flexibly adapt monitoring assignments to fit with the client’s life while emphasizing the  importance of doing some monitoring in the moment that a reaction occurs to facilitate the development of awareness as anxious habitual patterns unfold. For instance, clients could monitor only one situation a day, or use phones or audio recorders for monitoring rather than paper and pen.  forMAl MinDfUlness PrACTiCe  Mindfulness is a skill; therefore, practicing it regularly can be extremely helpful. Therapists help clients to determine when that they can set aside some amount of time in which to draw their awareness, again and again, to some aspect of their experience, such as the breath, physical sensations, or thoughts. Mindfulness-based treatments such as MBCT have clients practice for 45 minutes a day; we generally use shorter mindfulness practices and allow clients to choose the length of their practice. We do have all clients practice an adapted progressive muscle relaxation in which clients tense and release a series of muscle groups, noticing the sensations they experience.1 This gives anxious clients an extended exposure to mindfulness, while providing a focus for attention that may facilitate more prolonged practice. Clients vary in how much they keep up this particular practice versus other, shorter practices.  In our approach, therapists teach clients a progression of practices across the course of treatment, beginning with focus on the breath and body, moving to awareness of taste and sounds, then on to more challenging practices of awareness of emotions and thoughts. Clients and therapists practice together first in session, then discuss the client’s experience with the exercise. Initially, clients often label the practice as “good” or “bad,” “relaxing” or “stressful.” Therapists help clients move toward simply observing and describing their experience during the practice, recognizing that all practice is useful and so-called “bad” practice can teach a lot about how active one’s mind is and how repeatedly to bring awareness back to the moment despite a wandering mind.  When discussing in-session practice, therapists draw connections between the practice and clients’ presenting problems. For instance, one client reported that when she practiced mindfulness of her breath, her mind kept wandering to her frustration with her roommate, and it was clear that she was bad at mindfulness and was not ever going to get better. Her therapist related these self-critical thoughts and negative predictions to   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  those that often arose when the client took on a new task at work. The therapist suggested that if she practiced observing critical thoughts with compassion and curiosity during formal mindfulness, she might be able to carry these same skills into challenging work situations.   Clients often have trouble setting aside time to practice mindfulness regularly. Traditional problemsolving strategies can be used to find moments (during a subway commute, just after putting the kids to bed) to practice. Therapists also point out that practicing mindfulness may help the client become more efficient and alert throughout the day, so it may be worth some time. Clients can also use mindfulness as an avoidance strategy, particularly if they initially find the practice relaxing. Therapists need to attend to the function of practice behavior to be sure that clients are not using it to avoid unwanted internal experiences.  inforMAl MinDfUlness PrACTiCe  Although setting aside time to practice can be an excellent way to develop any skill, the goal is always to use the skill while engaging in life. Clients practice mindfulness informally by engaging mindfully in daily tasks such as washing the dishes (Nhat Hanh, 1992), eating, showering, or folding laundry. They gradually begin to practice in more challenging contexts, such as during conversations, dates, meetings at work, or community events. Therapists initially help clients to remember to practice mindfulness during sessions; over time clients begin to remind themselves to come back to the present moment while engaging in therapy, strengthening this skill so they can use it more effectively in their lives.  lAngUAge ConVenTions  Another way to help clients cultivate a decentered awareness of their experiences is to bring attention to their language and introduce a few strategies (drawn from ACT) that help one disentangle from one’s thoughts. One is to say (and think) “I’m having the thought that . . . ” or “I’m having the feeling that . . . ” as opposed to reporting thoughts as facts. Therapists model this and begin to reframe clients’ reports using this convention, gradually encouraging clients to make this change themselves. Similarly, therapists encourage clients to consider whether replacing “but” with “and” more accurately captures different situations. For instance, rather than saying, “I would really like to go  on this date, but I’m too anxious,” a client might say, “I would like to go on this date, and I’m also experiencing anxiety.” This highlights that feelings and thoughts do not have to lead to avoidance or escape behaviors.  Engaging in Actions  Finally, therapists help clients turn their attention and effort away from trying to control their internal experiences and instead focus on engaging more fully in their lives. Clients begin exploring what is important to them through a series of writing assignments. First, they describe how anxiety has gotten in the way of their lives in several domains (relationships, work–school– household management, and self-nourishment and community involvement). Next they write about how they would like to be in these areas, if they did not have any anxiety. From there, therapists help clients identify specific areas on which they want to focus. Therapy, then, involves making behavioral plans each week to do something the client values, such as making a social connection, asserting oneself at work, or joining a community organization. For each behavioral action, therapists emphasize the importance of choosing an action regardless of the thoughts and feelings that arise, and clients apply their mindfulness skills, so that they are able to do what matters to them even while anxious.  Shifting from habitual avoidance to engagement is a long, ongoing process. Some clients have difficulty articulating their values because all of their attentional and behavioral resources have been directed toward anxiety management for so long. Once clients have clarified what they find important, approaching these actions can be extremely anxiety provoking and hard to do. However, encouragement from the therapist, cultivation of mindfulness skills, and breaking tasks down into specific manageable pieces (e.g., asking a coworker to lunch, or having one open conversation with a parent) can help a client become willing to make these first important behavioral changes even though anxiety will inevitably be present. Over time, the experience of engaging in valued activities can be naturally reinforcing. Nonetheless, continued awareness and practice is needed so as not to fall back into old, natural patterns of avoidance due to anxiety.  Many challenges arise in pursuing valued actions. First, as Hayes and colleagues (2012) note, clients often think in terms of goals (e.g., finding a partner, losing 15 pounds) as opposed to values (e.g., being emotionally intimate, being physically healthy). Focusing on want    Generalized Anxiety Disorder  ing to lose 15 pounds can lead to self-criticism in the moment, which might interfere with that goal. On the other hand, a person can take actions in the moment that are consistent with wanting to be physically healthy (e.g., going to the gym or eating a healthy lunch) that in turn also help with a goal. Therapists work to help clients identify the values and meaning that underlie any stated goals, so that they can engage in actions in the moment that will be fulfilling and meaningful.  Therapists need to take care not to impose their own values onto clients. Cultural sensitivity is particularly important in this aspect of treatment. For instance, one client we treated with ABBT described a value of being able to provide financially for his parents, leading him to choose a profession that to him was less intrinsically interesting but would allow him to support his family. His therapist came from a more individualistic background and had an initial reaction that choosing a more intrinsically rewarding profession was important. However, the therapist recognized that this would impose his own values on the client rather than help the client to make choices consistent with his own values.  Therapists also need to be sensitive to the real-world constraints that can keep clients from engaging in actions that matter to them. External constraints such as limited resources, inequities, and family contexts need to be validated and accounted for in developing treatment assignments. Relatedly, clients may want others in their lives to act differently. Although this is a very reasonable desire, changing other people is not always possible. Clients can request changes in others or take steps to address injustices in different contexts, but therapists cannot guarantee that these things will lead to the changes for which the client is hoping. Instead, the therapist can help the client make the best choices possible in the face of these constraints, which can certainly include asking for changes and also leaving situations when possible, if necessary.  Relapse Prevention  Anxiety is a natural, habitual response, as is reactivity to internal experiences and experiential avoidance. Therapists help clients develop a plan for maintaining the practices they have found most helpful in treatment, and to prepare for potential “lapses” in the future. Clients are encouraged to refer to their handouts and monitoring sheets when difficulties arise, and to revisit concepts and practices they found helpful in treatment.  case stuDy  This composite case is largely based on a single client but with details from other clients added to illustrate certain points. Identifying information is altered to protect confidentiality.  Background Information  Héctor was a 24-year-old Latino man who presented for treatment after being placed on academic probation. Although Héctor had an extremely strong academic record as an undergraduate, he was struggling to keep up with the course demands in his first semester of medical school. Héctor initially sought treatment from his primary care provider for a wide variety of stress-related symptoms, including frequent headaches, muscle tension, and gastrointestinal distress. However, she urged him to seek therapy for what she believed to be an anxiety disorder.  In the initial assessment, Héctor endorsed symptoms consistent with GAD. He described a long history of worry that started in elementary school. His worry focused centrally on his academic demands. He reported worrying constantly about the quality of his work, the sufficiency of his knowledge, and his ability to meet his, and others, academic-related expectations. Héctor was the first person in his family to graduate from college, and his entire extended family was extremely proud of him and significantly invested in Héctor earning a medical degree. Héctor’s mother had secured a second job to help meet his rising tuition costs, one of his uncles offered to co-sign on a loan, and his cousin offered him a place to live rent-free. While he was extremely grateful for their support, Héctor constantly worried about disappointing them.  Héctor was also troubled by worries about his mother’s health and well-being. He was concerned that she was overextending herself with two jobs, and he worried that she might have a heart attack or fall asleep when driving home and die in a car accident. Héctor also worried a fair amount about his two nephews. In his view, they spent far too much time watching television and playing video games, and needed more structure and guidance than his brother was providing.  Héctor described a number of aches and pains that he attributed to his constant, high level of physical tension. He noted that he had considerable difficulty falling asleep each night, as his mind constantly cycled through a variety of potential, negative outcomes the   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  next day might bring. Not surprisingly, he described having a very difficult time concentrating, especially while he was in class and when he attempted to do his assigned reading. When his anxiety and worry became too severe, he would skip class and head to the gym. In the past, when he exercised long enough he would become so physically fatigued that he would fall asleep immediately when his “head hit the pillow.” Unfortunately, that coping strategy recently was becoming less and less effective. First, he found that he was skipping class for the gym more and more frequently, to the point that he was unable to keep up his grades. Moreover, although he was still falling asleep fairly quickly postexercise, recently, he would awaken after only 1 or 2 hours of sleep.  When he was in secondary school and college, Héctor also found that spending time with friends and family kept his GAD symptoms in check. However, 6 months earlier, he had left his support network behind in Miami and relocated to Boston for medical school. Although he initially went to out to eat with some of his classmates and occasionally attended study sessions with them, he never felt entirely comfortable at these events. He worried that his classmates did not think he belonged at such a prestigious medical school, and Héctor was acutely aware that he was one of very few ethnic/minority students.  Engagement Session  In this session, Héctor disclosed that his family did not know that he was in therapy, and that he was too ashamed to tell them about his academic issues. Héctor acknowledged that keeping these secrets was painful and distressing, particularly because it required him to distance himself even further from his main source of social support.  Although Héctor had attended a few counseling sessions in his first semester of college, he had no other history of psychotherapy. Héctor described his brief course of previous therapy as primarily supportive. He noted that meeting a few times with his Latino male therapist, mostly to talk about academic stressors, had been extremely helpful in his transition to college. This experience made him cautiously optimistic about the current course of therapy, although he acknowledged a fear that his problems might now be too severe to overcome completely.  Given the considerable outside-of-therapy demands associated with ABBT, the therapist asked Héctor about  potential barriers to treatment. Although Héctor had a slightly reduced schedule because of his academic probation, he was still taking three courses and working 20–30 hours a week. The therapist validated Héctor’s existing commitments, but she also wanted to be realistic in describing the additional time commitment that would be required, particularly in the first six to eight sessions of therapy. The therapist used the training for a marathon analogy to convey the importance of setting aside sufficient time for out-of-therapy assignments. She noted that Héctor’s worry habit was deeply ingrained, and that learning new methods of responding would require some commitment to practice. An athlete training for a marathon cannot keep the same work/life schedule while adding in training sessions. Instead, he/she needs to make some temporary accommodations to make time to run. Similarly, a client with GAD cannot develop new habits while maintaining the same busy schedule. Some time and attention must be allocated temporarily to reflecting on the treatment and practicing new ways of responding.  Finally, the (white) therapist explored how her gender and ethnicity might affect treatment.  tHeraPist: It sounds like one of the best things about your previous course of therapy was that you really felt understood by your therapist.  Héctor: Yes, I was surprised that I felt so comfortable with him. I expected that my counselor would be a woman and I was a little hesitant about talking with a man at first. . . . I thought he might think of me as weak for seeking therapy.  tHeraPist: I think most of us go to therapy with expectations about our therapist. We might expect a therapist to be older or younger, male or female, or of a particular ethnicity. Depending on whether or not the therapist meets our expectations, we may be more or less comfortable, feel more or less understood. Did you have any expectations coming in today?  Héctor: Honestly? I knew I was seeing a woman because of your name. And I wasn’t sure of your ethnicity. But frankly, I didn’t really expect to have a Latina therapist based on the providers I have seen at this center.  tHeraPist: Do you have any thoughts or concerns about working with me that you would like to talk about?   Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Héctor: Not really . . .  tHeraPist: My hope is that we can work really well together, but it would be understandable if you didn’t necessarily trust me or feel comfortable with me right off the bat. You don’t know me at all, and it can be really difficult to open up to a stranger. Also, I know that for some people it might matter that I’m not Latina, I’m white. Sometimes that can make someone feel like I can’t understand some kinds of experiences, like those related to being a minority or a person of color. But my goal is to do whatever I can to be sensitive to, and understanding of, your unique experiences. I bring some general expertise about anxiety to our work, including ways that experiences with discrimination can relate to anxiety, sometimes in subtle ways, but you are the expert on your own experience. So I will always try to check in with you about the ways in which the things we discuss and the suggestions I make fit with your experience. Please feel free to let me know if I say or do something insensitive, or if you feel like I am not fully understanding what you are telling me. I am definitely not perfect, but my intention is to try and help you as best I can achieve your goals for therapy.  The therapist ended the engagement session by providing some activities for Héctor to complete before the next session. First, she explained a monitoring form used throughout treatment (although the domains to monitor are changed over time as new session material is introduced, this version includes only date, situation, and worry topic as columns) and asked him to begin to notice when he engaged in worry. She also gave him a copy of the Valued Living Questionnaire to complete with the following instructions:  “Sometimes anxiety and worry can prevent us from taking some actions that are consistent with our values. For example, you mentioned that you skip class when you feel too anxious, even though you also noted that you care deeply about being a good student. Anxiety and worry can also make people feel as if they are on automatic pilot, or that their lives are consumed by things they must do rather than things they choose to do. This questionnaire is a first step toward identifying some of the ways in which anxiety and worry might be interfering with your life. Sometimes it is painful to think about the ways our lives are not as we would wish them to be.  But this awareness is a first step toward making a change. So, notice any feelings that arise as you fill out the forms, and we will be sure to talk about them next week.”  Session 1  The goal of Session 1 is to provide an overview of the treatment structure (client and therapist roles, betweensession assignments, etc.) and to plan and discuss the rationale for treatment that is informed by a personalized ABBT conceptualization of the client’s presenting problems. The therapist asked Héctor to engage in an experiential exercise that involved imagining himself back in one of the anxiety-provoking situations he noted on his monitoring form. Using guided imagery, the therapist helped Héctor to notice that his experience of anxiety was characterized by an interrelated cycle of thoughts (worries), physiological sensations (tightness in his shoulders and chest), and behaviors (leaving class early, heading to the gym).  Héctor: I didn’t realize so much was happening when I am anxious. Usually as soon as I notice I am anxious I just do whatever I can to prevent it from escalating.   tHeraPist: That doesn’t surprise me. You have developed a strong habit. When you get anxious, you immediately try and distract your attention from your experience and seek out ways to control or dampen your emotions. How difficult was it to imagine yourself back in class on Monday?  Héctor: It was surprisingly easy. I definitely felt just as anxious remembering how I felt as I did sitting in the classroom.  tHeraPist: That is a great thing to notice. Something that is uniquely human is our ability to remember and imagine events vividly. Like other animals, we are hardwired to experience fear in the face of a threat—as if a predator were charging at us. But humans can also simply imagine a threat in their minds and experience the same hardwired response to threat. Do you have any idea what you were imagining in class that day?  Héctor: On Monday, my mind just went from 0 to 100—I was barely aware of what I was thinking. But when we went through the exercise today, I noticed a series of pictures in my mind. First I thought, I am   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  not prepared for class. Then I imagined the professor yelling at me, my classmates laughing at me, my family’s disappointment . . .  tHeraPist: Hmm . . . if you imagined all those people rejecting you at the same time, it is not surprising that you would feel afraid. We are hardwired to seek social approval. If the entire academic community, your friends, and family all rejected you, you would have a pretty good reason for feeling afraid. Unfortunately, our minds don’t distinguish present threats from imagined ones.  The therapist and Héctor discussed the model of fear, anxiety, and worry guiding ABBT for GAD. The therapist explained that fear and anxiety serve adaptive functions. Anxiety allows us to imagine future threats and prepare for them. Fear energizes us to avoid and escape danger. In both of these states, our attention narrowly focuses on the threat and our escape plan, blocking out other information.  Unfortunately, our ability to think, imagine (the future), and remember (the past) allows us to imagine endless threats and to respond with fear even when no threat is present (i.e., our mental representations develop the same emotional properties as the events themselves, leading us to respond to threats that do not exist in the environment). Moreover, although we are hardwired to escape or avoid threat, sometimes in order to do the things that matter to us, we have to approach situations that will likely elicit anxiety (e.g., allow ourselves to be vulnerable in order to gain intimacy, take a risk at work in order to successfully negotiate a challenge). Many of us respond to this conundrum by harshly judging our natural responses and doing everything in our power to avoid experiencing them.  The therapist and Héctor also discussed the function of worry. Although worry is associated with clear negative consequences (interferes with concentration, results in tension and fatigue), it too serves a function.  Héctor: As much as my worry bothers me, in some ways, I am afraid to give it up. Sometimes it feels like the only thing I can do to control the uncontrollable.   tHeraPist: Interesting observation. Tell me more about that. Héctor: Well, sometimes it feel like if I stop worrying about my mother’s health, she will have a heart at   tack. Or I believe that if I don’t worry about a test, I won’t actually study.  tHeraPist: Some people notice that worrying about minor, everyday matters takes their mind off more painful thoughts and emotions. Have you ever noticed anything like that?  Héctor: (beginning to tear up) Sometimes I think worrying about tests, or being late to class, or what I should wear to a school event is the only thing that keeps me from noticing how lonely I am. Sometimes I feel like if I stopped worrying, I would become so sad and depressed I might never get out of bed.  Near the end of the session, the therapist summed up her conceptualization and plan for treatment.  “Anxiety and worry narrow our focus and pull our attention toward the future. This cycle happens outside of our awareness and can be difficult to change. In this treatment, we will use mindfulness skills to address this habit. Mindfulness increases and expands our present-moment focus and allows us to notice and break this cycle. We also have a tendency to judge and control our emotions because we think they are preventing us from having a satisfying life. In this treatment we will explore whether that reaction to our emotional responses is helpful or harmful, and we will consider alternative ways of responding. Finally, worry is anticipatory; thus, it prevents us from engaging in activities that could be threatening. But sometimes we want to approach these situations— especially if they will help us to live the kind of life we value. In this treatment, we will learn to become more flexible—to consider different behavioral responses—rather than automatically avoiding potentially anxiety-provoking situations.”  At the end of Session 1, the therapist led Héctor in a mindfulness of breath exercise. She began by guiding him to notice the way he was sitting in the chair, then drew his attention to where he could feel his breath in his body. The therapist then guided Héctor to gently redirect his awareness back to the sensations of his inhalations and exhalations over the next several minutes, while deepening his breath, no matter how many times his mind wandered to other things. After the therapist and Héctor discussed his experience of this exercise, she asked him to practice it daily between sessions.   Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Session 2  Session 2 primarily focuses on an introduction to mindfulness. The therapist led Héctor in a mindfulness of breath exercise, then engaged him in a debriefing.  tHeraPist: What did you notice?  Héctor: Well, I am pretty stressed out today. So the exercise didn’t work as well as it did when I practiced this week.  tHeraPist: Tell me more about that. How are you defining “worked”?  Héctor: I used the breathing almost every night this week to fall asleep. And it actually seemed to help. At least it calmed me down, so I could get to sleep quicker. But today, I just felt more stressed out.  tHeraPist: What is really interesting about that is that although there is no “goal” to mindfulness, sometimes we do start to expect that it will bring a certain state of being. But actually, this exercise is about noticing and accepting whatever state we are in. So we notice the focus of our attention, guide it to the breath, notice when it wanders, and guide it back. Sometimes that process can be pleasant and calming, but other times it can be frustrating and painful. But observing that process, whatever the process happens to be, is practicing mindfulness.  Héctor: Really? I was certain I was supposed to try and relax.  tHeraPist: We are naturally goal-oriented beings. So our tendency is to look for the goal in mindfulness. Fortunately, mindfulness allows us to give up goals, at least for a moment, and just be. What else did you notice?  Héctor: I couldn’t keep my attention on my breath. It was all over the place. I am not sure I have the personality needed to be mindful.  tHeraPist: What a great observation. First, you noticed your attention was pulled in different directions. I’ll bet that happens at other times in the day as well. It is useful to get to know just how busy our minds are.  Héctor: I never thought of it like that. I guess it makes sense that I struggle to concentrate in class if I am having so many different thoughts all the time.  tHeraPist: Also, I didn’t actually suggest that you should keep your attention on your breath. Just that  you should notice where your attention is and continually guide it back to the breath. It is so interesting how quickly our minds judge whether we are doing something “right” or “wrong,” isn’t it?  Héctor: (laughing) I sort of know what you are going to say here, but I also felt like I was breathing the wrong way. I kept breathing out of my mouth and it sounded so loud compared to your breath.  tHeraPist: (smiling) Great observation. If our minds are so judgmental about something as simple and natural as breathing, just imagine what judgmental thoughts are present when we are in class, at work, with friends. It sounds like you really used this exercise as an opportunity to get to know the habits of your mind.  The therapist also led Héctor in the Raisin Exercise, which simply involves the practice of eating one raisin mindfully. Following this exercise, she focused on the mindfulness skill of “beginners mind,” essentially highlighting the ways in which “knowing” what to expect sometimes prevent us from accurately observing different experiences. The session ended with the therapist leading Héctor through a slightly modified progressive muscle relaxation that was aimed at helping him to practice observing sensations and letting go of tension (rather than reduce anxiety).  Session 3  The therapist began Session 3 with the Mindfulness of Sounds mindfulness exercise. Héctor was able to see the similarity between this practice and the Raisin Exercise in Session 2. Specifically, he noticed that it was difficult for his mind to observe the pitch, tone, and volume of the sounds around him without trying to label (a truck backing up) and judge (“That is loud and annoying”) his experience. The therapist was careful to normalize this response and to highlight the utility of becoming aware of what we are all naturally inclined to do.  After reviewing Héctor’s monitoring and mindfulness homework, the therapist introduced a new psychoeducational topic—the function of emotions. Héctor quickly provided an example of the ways in which emotions such as fear can serve a communicative function. He described an incident when he was walking home from the library late at night. Although he did not hear or see anything out of the ordinary, Héctor had a sense   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  that he was in danger, so he took a number of precautionary steps: He took his headphones off, crossed the street to be in an environment with more lighting, and called his roommate on his cell phone. The next morning, Héctor read that there was a mugging the previous night on campus, and he was convinced that the fear signals he received protected him from being a victim. The therapist provided an example of the consequences of ignoring the messages our emotions provide.  tHeraPist: Imagine you are experiencing sadness and disappointment because your current job is not fulfilling. That sadness is uncomfortable, so you naturally want to get rid of it. You might spend your evenings zoning out watching television alone, trying to “relax,” or you might start staying out late at night with friends, drinking and trying to have a good time so you don’t notice that you’re feeling sad in that area of your life. You might start finding reasons to miss work or start daydreaming when you’re at work. These strategies are all aimed at reducing your sadness. And they might work in the short term, but none of them resolves the problem. What is worse is that those strategies might even create new problems as you start sleeping less, doing less well at work, and running into more conflicts at work. Even though you are doing everything you can to avoid feeling sad, the sadness is there for a reason. The first step to moving forward in that situation is noticing that you are feeling sad and recognizing that your work situation is eliciting these emotions. Only then can you decide what actions to take.  Héctor: That makes sense. But what about the fear I feel when I think about asking a classmate to study with me?  tHeraPist: What do you think your fear is telling you in that situation?  Héctor: That he might think up some excuse to reject me and say no.  tHeraPist: Absolutely. As humans we are hardwired to seek social support and approval. It can absolutely be risky to put ourselves out there to be accepted or rejected. But here is the thing. While it is important to acknowledge the message our emotions are sending, we don’t always have to follow their advice. Emotions are associated with action tendencies— when we feel fear, we are prepared to flee, when we feel anger, we are prepared to fight. But our emotions  don’t actually control our behavior. And often when we consider taking an action that could be really meaningful—opening up and appearing vulnerable to someone or taking on an academic challenge— our emotions will warn us that such a step is risky. In these cases, we need to acknowledge the message we are receiving, yet we can still choose to take the valued action.  Héctor: I guess that makes sense. I certainly knew that moving away from my family and starting medical school was risky. I felt a lot of fear, but I did it anyways because it is important to my family that I succeed. My abuela [grandmother] always says courage is acting with heart. Being afraid, but doing something anyways, because of love or passion.  However, Héctor also struggled a bit as he tried to determine the function of his emotions in some other contexts.  Héctor: I can see how emotions sometimes can serve a function. But other times the function seems much less clear to me. For example, I know a little test anxiety can be helpful and motivating, but why do I feel terrified some nights when I am studying. I get so scared and anxious that I become paralyzed. My problem is that most of the time I am confused by my emotions and their intensity.  tHeraPist: We make the distinction between what we call “clear” and “muddy” emotions. Clear emotions refer to when we have a very strong emotional response to a particular situation; for instance, we feel strong fear when a car approaches us on the street, which is what we might call a “clear” emotional response. Emotions that are complex, confusing, or too intense and long-lasting for the situation are what we call “muddy.”  Together, Héctor and his therapist reviewed how failures in self-care (e.g., not getting enough sleep or eating well, not exercising regularly) increase the likelihood of muddy emotions. They also considered ways that worry (which involves the ability to imagine things that have not yet happened) and rumination (which involves repeatedly remembering past events) both can elicit emotions that are not at all related to whatever is unfolding in the present moment. Finally they discussed the way our “reactions to our reactions” can muddy our emotional responses.   Generalized Anxiety Disorder  “Another thing that can make our emotions confusing and muddied is that often when we have an emotional response, we don’t just have that one response— we have a series of responses that are triggered by that first emotion. For instance, we may feel scared, then angry that we got scared, then afraid the feeling will grow stronger, then ashamed that we are afraid, and so on. We may also have thoughts that come up as responses to a clear emotion, such as “I shouldn’t feel this way,” “This is a sign that I am a weak person.” One reaction that we often have is to try to control emotional responses. We will talk more about that in the next session. Finally, emotional responses can also seem much more intense when we start to feel defined by our emotions—when we see them as stable traits that represent our personality rather than natural human responses to events that come and go.”  Normally Session 3 would end with a review of the first completed writing assignment (i.e., writing about how anxiety and worry interferes with relationships, work–school–household management, and selfnourishment and community involvement). However, Héctor admitted that he had not finished it. He noted that it had been a busy week with exams and that he found it hard to set aside time for himself. Together, Héctor and his therapist brainstormed ways he could schedule in the values writing. However, she also noted that sitting down and considering the ways that anxiety is interfering with the things that matter most could be a very painful exercise. The therapist suggested that Héctor recognize that the pain served a function (letting Héctor know that changes were needed for him to live a more personally fulfilling life), and she pointed out that seeking therapy was a sign that he acknowledged that pain and was willing to make some changes. The therapist also gave Héctor new monitoring forms that added a column for emotions, so he could begin to monitor his emotional responses in addition to his worry.  Session 4  Héctor presented to Session 4 visibly upset. He had just returned from a visit back home to Miami, and he was extremely upset over his interactions with his brother. As he began to describe the situation, the therapist gently interrupted.  “Excuse me for interrupting you, Héctor, but I have an important question. I can tell this visit was very upsetting for you and we will be sure to devote a good part of today’s session to talking about it. But if you are willing, I would like us to start out our session as we always do, with a brief mindfulness practice. It can really be challenging to practice when you are experiencing a lot of emotions and thoughts, yet it can also be extremely helpful. If you are willing, I would like us to start by becoming aware of the physical sensations we are currently experiencing. I would like to hear about your visit, and then there is another mindfulness exercise that might help us further explore what you are feeling right now. Would that be all right with you?”  Héctor agreed and the therapist introduced a mindfulness exercise that involved increasing awareness of physical sensations. During the debriefing of the practice, Héctor admitted that he found it particularly challenging to keep redirecting his attention from images of his visit to his physical sensations in the moment. However, he noted that it became easier over time. The therapist remarked that Héctor seemed more centered than he had when he first walked in. Héctor replied that he did feel more present and ready to discuss his concerns.   tHeraPist: Did you use your monitoring sheet this weekend to help you work through some of the challenges that arose during your visit home?  Héctor: Absolutely, I was so upset that I needed to get my thoughts down on paper. As I wrote here, on Saturday, when I was at my parent’s house but only my brother and his sons were home, I was flooded with worries. My nephews used to be such sweet little boys, but now they will barely make eye contact with me when I greet them. They spend all their time glued to their electronic devices playing violent video games. And my brother completely ignores them—all he wants to do is talk to me about his latest dating adventures.  tHeraPist: Did you notice the specific worries you were experiencing?  Héctor: Yes, I wrote I am worried that my brother and nephews are too much for my mother to handle. I am worried that they are draining her health and finances. I am worried that my nephews will not get a good education, and that they will get involved in the   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  wrong crowd. And I am worried my brother is drinking too much and that he is too selfish.  tHeraPist: Good job observing your responses. How about your emotions? Were you able to identify what emotion or emotions were present?  Héctor: I was very upset. Mostly angry I think. I don’t know—this is one of those situations where I felt confused about my feelings.  The therapist suggested that Héctor try a mindfulness practice aimed at observing his emotional responses. She asked him to close his eyes and vividly imagine his interaction with his brother, and she instructed him to notice visual and auditory stimuli, to focus on the physical sensations in his body, to bring his attention to the thoughts running through his mind and finally to his emotions. She reminded him simply to notice his experience, bringing curiousness and compassion to what he was experiencing, observing what happened when he was feeling strong emotions, without altering or judging them. She reminded him to notice whether more than one emotion was present, and to observe any rise and fall in his emotions. After several moments, she asked him to open his eyes.  tHeraPist: What did you notice?  Héctor: At first, all I felt was angry. Then I noticed I was feeling afraid. But what really surprised me is that I felt extremely sad. It’s interesting because at the time I thought I was just straight up angry, but thinking back on it I noticed that my emotions seemed to ebb and flow. I guess another thing that was interesting is that I started out just feeling the emotions. But throughout the exercise I started to notice I was observing them. It was really helpful to get some distance—before that I think I just felt consumed with emotion.  tHeraPist: Great observations. Tell me a bit more about your responses to those emotions. And any thoughts you have about their function.  Héctor: I think I felt angry because I disagree with how my brother is raising his sons. But then I got mad at myself for feeling angry. My brother hasn’t had the opportunities that I have. Thinking about that made me feel guilty.  tHeraPist: Did you notice any responses to your feelings of guilt? Héctor: I hate feeling guilty. It feels like a tremendous  weight on my chest. I think I tried to distract myself from that feeling and then I just started imagining all the problems that could result from my brother’s screwups and I got consumed with fear and worry. But then, when you prompted me, I returned back to observing my emotions. And then the more I focused on my emotions, I started to realize I felt really, really sad. But what was interesting was I think I just accepted it was a sad situation. Usually I can’t stand feeling sad, I am afraid it means I am going to get depressed and retreat into my own world. But I think I recognized that this is just a sad situation. I miss my family. I wish I could fix my brother’s problems, but I can’t.  The therapist tied Héctor’s experience to the topic of clear and muddy emotions. She pointed out that anger is a natural response that arises when someone acts against your wishes. And sadness is a normal response to a painful situation. She also helped Héctor identify why his anger was initially so intense. In addition to being angry about the situation on Saturday, he was also having anger about the many times in the past when his brother upset him. Héctor was also imagining that his brother would continue to “screw up,” which further fueled his anger. The “reactions to reactions” Héctor experienced also increased the intensity of his response. For example, when Héctor judged the feeling of anger as unacceptable, he started to feel guilty. And when the feeling of guilt was too painful, he distracted himself with multiple worries about the future.  Next, the therapist spent some time on the main concept of the session—the limits and consequence of internal control efforts. She asked Héctor to engage in a number of experiential exercises aimed at demonstrating the often paradoxical effects of efforts to control internal experiences such as thoughts, emotions, and images. For example, the therapist asked Héctor to imagine that he “had to get a good night’s sleep” before a big test. She asked him what might happen if, alarmed by the late hour, he purposefully tried to induce a state of sleepiness. Héctor noted that this frequently happened, and the more he tried, the more distressed and awake he became.  Finally, the therapist spent some time going over Héctor’s values assignment. Héctor easily identified many ways in which his anxiety was interfering with school and work. He noted that it was harder and harder to concentrate both during class and while doing his homework because his mind was consumed   Generalized Anxiety Disorder  with worries—worries about failing class, about letting down his family, and about his family’s health and well-being. Héctor also noted that when his anxiety about his family became too intense, he would call or plan a visit with them. But he found that when he did make the time to talk with or be with his family, he was consumed with worry about the time he was taking away from his schoolwork. Héctor wrote about his fear that he would never find a life partner. He was far too busy with school and his family to date, and he believed it was his destiny to end up alone. He was terrified about this possibility because he described himself as extremely family-oriented.  As the session ended, the therapist gave Héctor a monitoring form that added a column for “efforts to control,” so that he could begin to notice these as they occurred throughout the week. She also provided for Héctor a second values assignment to complete for the next session. The therapist noted that often our attempts to avoid anxiety, worry, and stress cause us to make subtle shifts in our behavior, so that we begin doing whatever we are “supposed” to be doing and lose track of what we want to be doing, or what personally matters to us as individuals. The therapist reviewed the distinction between values and goals, emphasizing the importance of identifying the direction that Héctor wants to move in rather than solely the goals to achieve. The therapist noted that this next assignment was aimed at further exploring three areas of living to see what changes might be necessary to improve Héctor’s quality of life.  “Choose two or three relationships that are important to you. You can either pick actual relationships (your relationship with your brother) or relationships you would like to have (“I would like to be part of a couple,” “I would like to make more friends”). Briefly write about how you would like to be in those relationships. Think about how you would like to communicate with others (e.g., how open vs. private you would like to be, how direct vs. passive you would like to be in asking for what you need and in giving feedback to others). Think about what sort of support you would like from other people and what sort of support you can give without sacrificing your own self-care. I also would like you to write briefly about the sort of work you would like and why that appeals to you. Next write about the student you would like to be with respect to your work habits and your relationships with your professors and peers.  What is important to you about the product of your work/studies. How would you like to communicate to others about your work? How would you like to respond to feedback? What additional challenges would you like to take on? Finally, I would like you to briefly write about the ways in which you would like to spend your free time. What would you like to do to better nourish yourself (e.g., nutrition, exercise, spirituality) or contribute to your community?”  Sessions 5–7  In Sessions 5–7 of treatment, the focus is on encouraging the client to consider moving from a stance of resistance and avoidance to one of willingness. A number of mindfulness and other experiential exercises are used to help clients practice observing their thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations as transient events. For example, Héctor practiced imagining that his thoughts and feelings were going by on a movie screen in front of him. Once clients are able to defuse or decenter from their internal experiences, and they no longer feel defined or threatened by them, they are often more willing to approach and engage in a variety of activities.  Like many clients, Héctor initially struggled a bit with the concept of willingness. At first Héctor thought the therapist was suggesting that he should come to view his anxiety in a more positive light. Or that he should learn to accept his anxiety because it was what a “strong man” needed to do. Using a metaphor adapted from ACT, his therapist tried to clarify the concept of willingness, likening it to one’s willingness to wade through a swamp on a journey to a beautiful mountain.  “Taking a stance of willingness suggests that you will accept and move forward with the thoughts and feelings (rational or irrational) that appear as you make your way through life, taking the actions that will help you obtain the things in life that you value. For instance, let’s say that you want to ask your classmates if you can join their study group. To do so will likely elicit feelings of fear, thoughts about possible rejection. However, you can be willing to experience those thoughts and feelings, if they are what arise when you take actions consistent with your value to engage in your schoolwork. You may not like the feelings, you may wish it could be another way, but you can be willing to experience whatever comes up in order to take a valued action.   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  “It is as if you are on a journey to a beautiful mountain. But along the way you come to a disgusting, murky swamp. You don’t want to walk through the swamp, and it may not seem fair that you need to do so. But you can choose to walk through if you decide that the journey to the mountain is worth it to you.  “Now if the swamp is to the side of your path, you do not necessarily need to go through it. And, you don’t have to dive into the swamp and roll around in it. And you can put on boots, or walk across a plank, in an effort to avoid getting dirty. Yet you might still trip and fall in the swamp, and willingness means you accept that possibility as you move forward on the journey of your choosing.”  Several values assignments are used to help clients set their course or mountain “journey.” As noted earlier, Héctor was asked to write about his values in three specific domains. This can be a challenging assignment, and often clients confuse values with goals, describe values that suggest the need for control or perfection, or focus on what they perceive to be insurmountable obstacles to living consistently with their values. Thus, often several sessions are devoted to discussing the values assignment, and it is not uncommon for clients to revise their values multiple times in session and for homework. For example, Héctor’s initial writing assignment produced some values that could have been problematic for him to pursue.  Héctor: My value in the schoolwork domain is to achieve the highest grades in all of my coursework. I want to be the top student in my graduating class so that I can make my family proud.  tHeraPist: Would aiming to receive a perfect score on an exam be an example of a value or a goal? Héctor: Right, grades are outcomes, so I guess those are goals.  tHeraPist: Imagine that you are working as a physician. You are surfing the Internet and you stumble upon a webpage where patients rate, and leave comments about, their doctor. What would you want the page to say? My doctor scores well on standardized tests?  Héctor: (chuckling) Well, no. I guess I would want them to say that I was caring and compassionate. And that I was willing to stick with a health problem  until I came up with the right diagnosis and the best treatment I could provide.  tHeraPist: Great, those sound a bit more like values. So, would it be fair to say you want to be engaged with the material you are learning? And that you want to be kind and compassionate toward your patients and committed to their health?  Héctor: Yes, that is what I value. I keep thinking my grades matter most, but I know in my heart that is not why I am in medical school. I am not here to impress my instructors and classmates. I want to be a doctor who makes a difference in the lives of others.  Héctor also struggled a bit with articulating his relationship values:  Héctor: I wrote that I always wanted to be available to my mother, whenever she needed me. I want to be her rock. I get so angry at myself when I am too tired to return her phone calls at night. Or when she needs something to be fixed, like the leaky faucet in the kitchen, and I can’t take care of it because I am here in Boston and she is in Miami. Also, I feel bad when she is lonely. I want to prevent her from having to experience any more pain than she already has.  tHeraPist: I know you care deeply for your mother. And I can completely understand your desire to care for her. And yet, much like it is humanly impossible to prevent yourself from feeling emotions, I think it is humanly impossible to ensure that our loved ones are never in pain or in need. Even if you dropped out of medical school and moved back home, there are limits to what you can do for her. And that can be a very difficult and painful thing to accept. It sounds to me like the value is that you want to maintain a strong, caring relationship with your mother. Would you agree?  Héctor: Absolutely.  tHeraPist: And fixing a faucet and returning a call are actions that are consistent with those values. Are there other actions you can take that reflect your values? In other words, if you are in Boston and she is in Miami, can you care for her without fixing her faucet?  Héctor: Well, I could talk to her about it. She appreciates when I listen to her vent about her problems.  tHeraPist: Great, what else?   Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Héctor: I guess I could call a repair man for her. Or ask my brother to help.  tHeraPist: Wonderful. The point is, there are many actions one can take that are consistent with a value. If we define valued action as just one or two responses, and for whatever reason, we can’t respond in those ways, we can end up feeling stuck and miserable. Living consistently with one’s values means flexibly considering multiple options to act in ways that are meaningful to us.  Héctor also struggled with articulating his values in relation to his brother and nephews:  Héctor: I want to be close to my brother and his sons, but I can’t. It doesn’t matter how I treat them, they are selfish and they never want to spend time with me.  tHeraPist: One of the most complicated things about relationship values is that we only have control over half of the relationship. You cannot control how your brother acts; you can only choose how you want to approach him.  Héctor: Are you saying I should just let my brother live his life the way he currently does? Allow him to raise his sons to be disrespectful and rude?  tHeraPist: It is so painful for you to watch your brother make choices that are inconsistent with your values. And I know if you could control his behavior you would. It seems like you keep trying and trying to figure out how to control a situation that just might be out of your control. Sometimes mindfulness skills can help us to clearly accept the reality of a situation. And by “accept” I mean recognize the reality of the situation—I don’t mean that you should like or support his approach. But you may need to accept the reality that you only have control over some parts of this very painful situation. It seems to me that you can control how you choose to define your values regarding how you relate to your brother. But you can’t control his behavior. If you act lovingly toward him and try to establish a close relationship, your brother may respond in kind. And that bond might allow you to talk with him about your parenting concerns. Or you might end up with a closer relationship and he could continue with his current habits. Or he may completely reject your efforts to become closer. Choosing our actions is like aiming an arrow. We  can make choices about how we aim and when we release the arrow. We don’t have control over where the arrow lands. However, we may notice where it lands and use that information to inform the way we aim or when we shoot the next time. In a similar way, we can choose the actions we want to take repeatedly, although we don’t have control over the consequences of our actions.  Héctor continued to work on defining his values, until he felt that he could clearly articulate what mattered to him in the domains of relationship, schoolwork, selfnourishment, and community involvement. Although it is necessary for clients to achieve this milestone so that they can move into the next phase of treatment, it is important to recognize that values articulation is a dynamic process. Having defined values is helpful in guiding the final nine sessions of treatment, but what is most important is for clients to adopt the general perspective that valuing can provide a compass for directing behavior and improving quality of life.  During these sessions, Héctor was given a final version of the monitoring form that represented an application of the full model. This included columns for date/time, situation, first reactions (thoughts, feelings, sensations), second reactions (efforts to control, muddiness, willingness, acceptance), and actions/responses (e.g., avoidance, valued action, application of mindfulness skills).  Sessions 8–12  The goal of Sessions 8–12 was to personalize the concepts introduced in the first phase of treatment and help Héctor to apply mindfulness and engagement in valued activities to his daily life. At the beginning of each session, Héctor and the therapist worked together to pick a mindfulness practice. Each week they purposely chose exercises, including ones that Héctor found particularly challenging, those he found most useful, and those that seemed to best fit his needs given the particular struggle he was facing (see Table 5.1).  The bulk of these sessions were focused using the mindfulness and acceptance strategies introduced during Phase I to increase Héctor’s willingness to engage in his personally articulated valued actions. Héctor continued to monitor valued actions taken, missed opportunities, mindfulness and obstacles to willingness (see Figure 5.1).   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  table 5.1.

Specifically, one of his favorite instructors had offered to meet with Héctor to discuss the process of selecting rotations, but Héctor had cancelled the appointment.  tHeraPist: What did you notice about your response to his offer?  Héctor: At first I was excited, but as time went on I became more and more anxious.  tHeraPist: Can you identify the clear emotions that arose?  Héctor: I actually used the Mindfulness of Emotion exercise to sort this out a bit.

This week, at the end of each day we would like you to think about an action that you took that was consistent with one of your values or an opportunity that you missed to take an action consistent with your value. Briefly describe the action and mark T for taken or M for missed.  On a scale of 0–100 rate how mindful you were during the action or the missed opportunity.  Note any obstacles that you noticed that stopped you from taking action (or could have).  There are no right or wrong answers to this assignment—we all choose not to engage in valued actions for a variety of reasons. This is just a way for us to start to get a better sense of what may be getting in the way for you so that you can make choices as to how you would like to proceed.

Were you also able to observe your reaction to your reactions?  Héctor: Honestly, not until today. I think at the time I just got caught up in my reactions rather than observing them. But during the mindfulness practice today I noticed some of the same old responses I always have. I was afraid to feel good about myself, and my prospects for the future. I had that same sense that worrying about what could go wrong was what I needed to do to ensure that I don’t mess up. I also became pretty critical and judgmental about my anxiety.  tHeraPist: What do you think you could have done differently?  Héctor: I have become kind of lax when it comes to filling out the monitoring forms. But I was thinking about what you said last week. I do think that the process of physically completing the form in the midst of my distress can help me to take a pause . . . and remember some of my skills.  Session 11 brought a more challenging issue into therapy. Héctor was extremely distressed over an interaction he had with a university security officer. Héctor was on his way back home from a long night studying when he was approached by a security officer and asked to produce his university identification card. Although it was close to midnight, Héctor observed at least five other students crossing the campus, yet he was the only one who was questioned. Héctor was already sensitive to the fact that he had been the only person of color in the library that night. He was stressed out over exams, missing his family and friends, and frankly tired of dealing with the subtle and obvious discrimination he encountered on a daily basis. Thus, he refused to produce his identification card and reported that he “lost” it and shouted at the officer. Although the situation was eventually sorted out, Héctor was angry, embarrassed over his behavior in the situation, and confused.  Héctor: I am really struggling with this incident. My mind is racing, I feel tense all over and I can’t sort out what is clear and what is muddy and, more importantly, what valued action I could have chosen.  tHeraPist: It is natural to experience a rush of conflicting thoughts and emotions in such a painful en   counter. I am so sorry that, given the racism inherent in our society, you are subjected to differential treatment because of how you look. This structural problem exists outside of you and isn’t your fault. And I really understand how the pain and the anger can build up when you have to deal with things like this all the time. I certainly don’t want to suggest that you have to change who you are, when the system needs changing. However, I would like us to work with this situation to help you find an effective way of dealing with this kind of thing because we both know that racism isn’t going to go away immediately, and that means you have to make choices about how you want to respond. If you are willing, let’s spend some time with a mindfulness practice to see if that helps us gain some clarity.  Héctor: I don’t feel very open right now, but I do think “Inviting a Difficulty In and Working with It through the Body” (see Figure 5.2) could be a first step.  Following the exercise, Héctor appeared more settled, although he also had tears in his eyes.  tHeraPist: What did you notice?  Héctor: It was pretty easy to locate the tension—it was in the pit of my stomach. But I really struggled with opening up to it. My first response was “I don’t want to let go off the struggle against racism. Why should I accept it”? But then I remembered the last time we did this exercise. And I reminded myself that I only had to be open to the present moment. I remembered that acceptance didn’t mean resigning myself to a situation. Instead, I focused on accepting that the incident had occurred and that I was rigidly holding tension in my body.  tHeraPist: I am really impressed that you were able to do that. What happened next?  Héctor: I continued to breathe into my stomach and I worked on letting go of my tension. Once my body became more relaxed I turned my attention to my thoughts about the incident.  tHeraPist: And what did you observe?  Héctor: I had thoughts about racism and how unjust it is for people to be treated differently based on their appearance. I felt angry, which I think was a clear emotion, but then I started to feel ashamed of my behavior.  tHeraPist: Was that reaction clear or muddy?   Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Before you begin this exercise, think of a difficulty you’re experiencing right now. It doesn’t have to be a significant difficulty, but choose something that you find unpleasant, something that is unresolved. It may be something you are worried about, an argument or misunderstanding you’ve had, something you feel angry, resentful, guilty, or frustrated about. If nothing is going on right now, think of some time in the recent past when you felt scared, worried, frustrated, resentful, angry, or guilty, and use that.  Noticing the way you are sitting in the chair or on the floor. Noticing where your body is touching the chair or floor. Bringing you attention to your breath for a moment. Noticing the in-breath . . . and the out-breath. . . . Now gently widening your awareness, take in the body as a whole. Noticing any sensations that arise, breathing with your whole body.  When you are ready, bringing to mind whatever situation has been bringing up difficult emotions for you. Bringing your attention to the specific emotions that arise and any reactions you have to those emotions. And as you are focusing on this troubling situation and your emotional reaction, allowing yourself to tune in to any physical sensations in the body that you notice are arising . . . becoming aware of those physical sensations . . . and then deliberately, but gently, directing your focus of attention to the region of the body where the sensations are the strongest in the gesture of an embrace, a welcoming . . . noticing that this is how it is right now . . . and breathing into that part of the body on the in-breath and breathing out from that region on the out-breath, exploring the sensations, watching their intensity shift up and down from one moment to the next.  Now, seeing if you can bring to this attention an even deeper attitude of compassion and openness to whatever sensations, thoughts, or emotions you are experiencing, however unpleasant, by saying to yourself from time to time, “It’s OK. Whatever it is, it’s already here. Let me open to it.”  Staying with the awareness of these internal sensations, breathing with them, accepting them, letting them be, and allowing them to be just as they are. Saying to yourself again, if you find it helpful, “It’s here right now. Whatever it is, it’s already here. Let me be open to it.” Softening and opening to the sensation you become aware of, letting go of any tensing and bracing. If you like, you can also experiment with holding in awareness both the sensations of the body and the feeling of the breath moving in and out as you breathe with the sensations moment by moment.  And when you notice that the bodily sensations are no longer pulling your attention to the same degree, simply return 100% to the breath and continue with that as the primary object of attention. And then gently bringing your awareness to the way you are sitting in the chair, your breath, and, when you are ready, opening your eyes.  figUre 5.2.

Héctor: Well, I think a bit of both. I definitely was able to bring some compassion to myself. No one wants to be treated differently based on his/her appearance.  tHeraPist: That is great. I know it is not easy for you to take a compassionate stance toward your thoughts and actions. What do you think was clear about the response?  Héctor: I am ashamed of my behavior. It is inconsistent with my values to treat anyone the way I treated that officer, even if he/she deserves it. Frankly, I don’t care what he thinks of me, but I care what I think about myself.  tHeraPist: It sounds like you said and did some things  that were inconsistent with your values. I wonder, though, if you can bring some compassion to yourself for that. Although we intend to behave consistently with our values, we all have lapses. This was a highly charged situation, and you were vulnerable going into it. The important thing is that you are now even more aware of your values. Are there any consistent actions you can take this week?  Héctor: This incident made me realize that my values have been a bit too off balance lately. I have been paying a lot of attention to the schoolwork domain and a pretty good amount of attention to the relationship domain, but I think I need to take some actions consistent with my values regarding self-nourishment   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  and community. At the beginning of the semester I grabbed a flyer for the Latino Medical Student Association, and I think I am going to contact them to see if there are some activities I can get involved with.  tHeraPist: That sounds great.  Héctor: I also think I might try and meet with someone from campus security. I think I want to apologize for my behavior, but I also want to talk to them about cultural sensitivity training. And don’t worry, I didn’t forget about the arrow thing we talked about a few weeks ago. I can only aim the arrow; I can’t control where it lands. I know I might not change their practices, but these actions are consistent with my values.  Sessions 13–16  Héctor completed a treatment reflection writing assignment that set the stage for the final four sessions of therapy. He identified a few specific valued actions that he wanted to take before the end of therapy. He also recognized that although he was maintaining a pretty steady formal mindfulness practice, he had paid less attention to informal mindfulness. Héctor also had made great gains in increasing his self-compassion, but he felt that he needed more practice while he still had the support of therapy.  Thus, Sessions 13–15 continued to follow the structure of Sessions 8–11, but with added attention to issues of maintenance. The therapist become less and less directive throughout this time, allowing Héctor to address obstacles and experience success himself. During this time, Hector began to date and expand his social network, feel more satisfied with his relationships with his family members, and find more success and satisfaction in his schoolwork.  During the final session, the therapist predicted that there would be times when Héctor would feel overwhelmed by emotion, drift away from his mindfulness practice, and lose sight of his values, despite all the notable gains he reported. She described these “lapses” as a natural part of the process of life and helped Héctor to make plans for how to cope. Specifically, she suggested that he review the handouts in his binder, begin selfmonitoring again, increase or reengage in mindfulness practice, and consider doing some values writing. The therapist and Héctor collaboratively developed a personalized list of elements that were particularly helpful for him and added that list to his binder. Héctor ex   pressed sadness at saying good-bye to his therapist, and also excitement at feeling able to continue his progress on his own and use the time allocated to therapy to engage in other valued actions moving forward.  coNclusioN  Evidence suggests that this ABBT for GAD can target symptoms of GAD, comorbid presenting problems, and proposed mechanisms that underlie these clinical presentations, while helping clients to engage in their lives in satisfying ways. This chapter has presented a conceptual basis for this treatment, as well as guidelines for its flexible application, while remaining responsive to the specific context of a given client. More research is needed to better understand mechanisms and processes of change, as well as how to disseminate this treatment in community and primary care settings.  aCknowledgMents  We thank the therapists, students, and clients we have worked with over the years for all they have taught us, as well as National Institutes of Health for funding our work (Grant No. MH074589). We also thank Dave Barlow, Tim Brown, Bonnie Brown, and the staff at the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders for supporting our research over the past 10 years. We dedicate this chapter to Tom Borkovec, whose seminal work in the treatment of GAD is the sturdy foundation on which our work stands.  note  1.

CHaPter 6  emotional Disorders  A Unified Transdiagnostic Protocol  laura a. PayNe kristeN k. ellarD toDD J. farchioNe christoPher P. fairholMe DaviD h. Barlow  in this chapter we describe the most recently developed treatment protocol from the Center for Anxiety and related Disorders at Boston University. in this “unified” transdiagnostic protocol, therapeutic principles common to psychological treatment of the various emotional disorders have been distilled and integrated into a single protocol that is, in theory, applicable to the full range of emotional disorders. Unlike protocols for specific problems or disorders described in other chapters, this new approach is only beginning to benefit from efforts to establish extensive empirical validation. But the components that make up this treatment have achieved wide and deep empirical support, and initial outcomes of this protocol are promising. What is new about this approach is the systematic manner in which the treatment components are applied across disorders, as well as theoretical developments leading to reconceptualization of the principal target of treatment as a common, higher order temperament undergirding disorders of emotion rather than specific DsM‑defining system clusters. The major advantage, of course, in addition to greatly simplifying dissemination by eliminating numerous overlapping single‑disorder protocols, is that this approach also takes into consideration the extensive comorbidity often found among emotional disorders. This approach is illustrated in the treatment of “Joseph.”—D. H. B.  When the first edition of this book was published in 1985 it was the dawn of evidence-based psychological treatments. Descriptions of only those treatments with sufficient empirical support that were broadly applicable to large numbers of individuals with various forms of psychopathology at that time were included. Over succeeding editions of this book some new treatment approaches with wide appeal and strong empirical support have been added, whereas others have been  deleted. In addition, the field has matured to the point where public health services around the world have directed that evidence-based psychological treatments become an integral part of health care delivery systems due to their effectiveness, efficiency, and durability (Clark, 2012; Nathan & Gorman, 2007; Ruzek, Karlin, & Zeiss, 2012). It is also a sign of the maturity of a field to examine closely the limitations of existing evidence. Obviously, a considerable number of patients still do  237   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  not respond as well as would be desirable to our current arsenal of psychological (or drug) treatments, and there is plenty of room for improvement.  Another problem that has become apparent, particularly in the context of emotional disorders, is that there now exists a plethora of treatment protocols for each of the discrete anxiety and mood disorders. Although these protocols, by and large, have proven useful and been well received, it takes a significant amount of training to become sufficiently familiar with the distinct protocols to integrate them into clinical practice (Barlow, Bullis, Comer, & Ametaj, 2013). Unless these treatments become more “user-friendly” as recommended, clinicians are less likely to have a sufficient understanding of, or access to, these evidence-based treatments for the emotional disorders (McHugh & Barlow, 2012). In this chapter, we present a unified protocol (UP) for the transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders. “Emotional disorders” in our conception include not only the anxiety, depressive, obssessive–compulsive, and trauma-related disorders but also other classes of disorders in which the experience and regulation of emotion plays a prominent role, such as the somatic disorders, dissociative disorders, and, to some extent, the eating disorders. Borderline personality disorder can also be conceptualized as a disorder of extreme emotional dysregulation (Sauer-Zavala & Barlow, 2013; Neacsiu & Linehan, Chapter 10, this volume) and may fit within our UP conceptualization. Our science and practice have advanced sufficiently that there are now several strong arguments for developing such an approach, in addition to the very practical advantage of substantially reducing the number of existing protocols. We touch on these arguments here before describing the treatment components of the UP in some detail, in keeping with the long-standing format of this book.  ratioNale for a uNifieD aPProach  Perhaps the strongest argument for a unified transdiagnostic treatment approach to emotional disorders is an emerging body of evidence supporting commonalities in the etiology of these disorders that we have summarized recently in the form of a new etiological model referred to as “triple vulnerability” (Barlow, 1991, 2000, 2002; Suárez, Bennett, Goldstein, & Barlow, 2009). Of course, it is important to note that shared etiological pathways or pathophysiological processes are not yet firmly established, and that emotional disorders and  their subtypes may each turn out to be associated with unique underlying pathology (reflecting a true categorical organization) with identifiable taxa. Yet we believe that the evidence on shared pathological processes is sufficiently strong at present to justify a transdiagnostic treatment approach.  A second argument focuses on conceptions of the major emotional disorders that emphasize their commonalities rather than their differences. The “spectrum” approach is one manifestation of this conception. For example, high rates of comorbidity suggest considerable overlap among disorders. The observed effects of current psychological treatments on comorbid conditions also point to at least a partial nonspecificity of treatment response. From a phenomenological perspective, emerging research on the latent structure of dimensional features of emotional disorders reveals a hierarchical structure that can accommodate these disorders. The sections to follow briefly review evidence relevant to these arguments.  Etiology  We have described in some detail an interacting set of vulnerabilities or diatheses relevant to the development of anxiety, anxiety disorders, and related emotional disorders. This “triple vulnerability” theory encompasses a generalized biological vulnerability, a generalized psychological vulnerability, and a specific psychological vulnerability emerging from early learning (Barlow, 2000, 2002; Suárez et al., 2009). Much of the research on generalized biological and psychological vulnerabilities has focused on a temperament labeled, variously, “neuroticism,” “negative affect,” “behavioral inhibition,” or “trait anxiety.” Although the relationships among these closely related traits and temperaments have yet to be worked out fully, it seems that they substantially overlap and represent a common theme associated with a biological vulnerability to develop emotional disorders (Barlow, 2000, 2002; Campbell-Sills, Liverant, & Brown, 2004; Suárez et al., 2009). We have come to refer to this temperament by its most traditional label “neuroticism” (Barlow, Sauer-Zavala, Carl, Bullis, & Ellard, in press; Eysenck, 1947). A generalized biological vulnerability involves nonspecific genetic contributions to the development of neuroticism. Additionally, early life experiences fostering a sense that events, particularly negative events, are unpredictable or uncontrollable, contribute to a generalized psychological vulnerability, or diathesis,   Emotional Disorders  to develop neuroticism later on. If a generalized biological and a generalized psychological vulnerability happen to line up and are potentiated by the influence of life stress, the likely result is a development of the two closely related clinical syndromes of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and/or depressive disorders. Notice that false alarms (panic attacks) may also occur as a function of stressful life events, facilitated by high levels of baseline anxiety. But these false alarms seem to have a different heritability than anxiety and are not necessarily implicated in a clinical disorder. For that to occur, an additional layer of a more specific psychological vulnerability must be considered. In particular, certain learning experiences seem to focus anxiety on specific life circumstances, and these circumstances or events are associated with a heightened sense of threat or danger. For example, specific early learning experiences seem to determine whether individuals may view somatic sensations, intrusive thoughts, or social evaluation as specifically dangerous (Barlow, 2002; Bouton, Mineka, & Barlow, 2001); that is, to take one example, individuals with social anxiety often have in their background admonitions from parents or family always to be on their best behavior and to look their best, to avoid the dreaded consequence of being negatively evaluated or “disapproved of” by others. It is this specific psychological vulnerability that, when coordinated with the generalized biological and psychological vulnerabilities mentioned earlier, seems to contribute to the development of discrete anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias. This model is also applicable to obsessive–compulsive and trauma and stressor-related disorders. For instance, in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), individuals often report learning from authority figures that having a thought is as bad as engaging in the action (i.e., having the thought about shaking a newborn infant to quiet it is as bad as actually shaking the infant). Existing evidence for this “triple vulnerability” model has been reviewed in detail elsewhere (Bouton et al., 2001; Chorpita & Barlow, 1998; Suárez et al., 2009) and is consistent with the overriding importance of common factors in the genesis and presentation of emotional disorders.   Latent Structure of the Emotional Disorders  Whereas the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth and fifth editions (DSM- IV-TR and DSM-5; American Psychiatric Associa   tion, 2000, 2013) highlight a “splitting approach” to nosology, in an attempt to achieve high rates of diagnostic reliability, this achievement may have come at the expense of diagnostic validity; that is, the current system may be highlighting categories that are minor variations of more fundamental underlying syndromes. Quantitative approaches using latent variable methodology are now capable of examining the full range of anxiety and mood disorders, and their interrelationships, without the constraints of existing (possibly) artificial categories (Brown, Chorpita, & Barlow, 1998; Chorpita, Albano, & Barlow, 1998; Clark, 2005; Clark & Watson, 1991; Watson, 2005). We have been studying this question for a number of years. For example, Brown and colleagues (1998), using a sample of 350 patients with DSM-IV anxiety and mood disorders, confirmed a hierarchical structure to the emotional disorders. In this structure, trait negative affect and trait positive affect were identified as crucial higher-order factors to the DSM-IV disorder factors, with significant paths from negative affect to each of the five DSM-IV disorder factors (GAD, social phobia, panic disorder, OCD, and major depression). Interestingly, low positive affect emerged with significant paths to major depression and social phobia only. In this model, autonomic arousal represents the phenomenon of panic, and this arousal emerges as a lower-order factor with significant paths from panic disorder and GAD (where the relationship was negative).  A separate study followed 606 patients with DSM- IV anxiety and mood disorders over the course of 2 years found further support for this hierarchical model (Brown, 2007). Replicating earlier cross-sectional findings, the two higher-order temperament dimensions of neuroticism/behavioral inhibition/negative affectivity and behavioral activation/positive affectivity accounted for virtually all of the covariance among DSM-IV disorder constructs (GAD, social phobia, and major depression). Furthermore, the rate of change in neuroticism/ behavioral inhibition over the study period accounted for virtually all of the covariance among the rate of change in DSM-IV disorder constructs. Findings such as these suggest that commonalities among emotional disorders outweigh the differences. We have concluded from this research that DSM-IV emotional disorder categories are best considered as useful concepts or constructs that emerge as “blips” on a general background of neuroticism/behavioral inhibition but may not be the best way to organize nosology (Brown & Barlow, 2009).   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  Overlap among Disorders  At the diagnostic level, the overlap among the emotional disorders is most evident in the high rates of current and lifetime comorbidity (e.g., Brown, Campbell, Lehman, Grisham, & Mancill, 2001; Kessler et al., 1996; Roy-Byrne, Craske, & Stein, 2006; Tsao, Mystkowski, Zucker, & Craske, 2002, 2005). Results from Brown, Campbell, and colleagues (2001) indicate that 55% of patients with a principal anxiety disorder had at least one additional anxiety or depressive disorder at the time of assessment. But if one examines for the presence of a disorder over the lifetime of the patient, whether it is present or not at the time of interview, this rate increases to 76%. To take one example, 60% of 324 patients diagnosed with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD/A) were determined to meet criteria for either an additional anxiety or mood disorder, or both. Specifically 47% presented with an additional anxiety disorder and 33% with an additional mood disorder. When lifetime diagnoses are considered, the percentages rise to 77% experiencing any anxiety or mood disorder, breaking down to 56% for any anxiety disorder and 60% for any mood disorder. If posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or GAD were the principal (most severe) diagnoses, comorbidity rates were highest. Merikangas, Zhang, and Aveneoli (2003) followed almost 500 individuals for 15 years and found that relatively few people suffer from anxiety or depression alone. When a single disorder did occur at one point in time, the additional mood state would almost certainly emerge later.  Several possible explanations for these high rates of comorbidity have been reviewed extensively elsewhere (Brown & Barlow, 2002). Among these are relatively trivial issues with overlapping definitional criteria; artifactual reasons, such as differential base rates of occurrence in our setting; and the possibility that disorders are sequentially related, and that the features of one disorder act as risk factors for another disorder. For example, depression seems to follow PDA, and PDA seems to follow PTSD. But the more intriguing explanation, for our purposes, first offered by individuals such as Gavin Andrews and Peter Tyrer (Andrews, 1990, 1996; Tyrer, 1989; Tyrer et al., 1998), is that this pattern of comorbidity argues for the existence of what has been called a “general neurotic syndrome.” Andrews and Tyrer have suggested that the difference in the expression of emotional disorder symptoms (individual variation in the prominence of social anxiety,  panic attacks, anhedonia, etc.) is simply a trivial variation in the manifestation of a broader syndrome. This, in turn, is consistent with “triple vulnerability” models mentioned earlier, that anxiety (and mood) disorders emerge from shared psychosocial and biological/genetic diatheses. If this is the case, then a unified treatment protocol cutting across current diagnostic categories to address core features of the anxiety and mood disorders could be a more parsimonious, and, perhaps, powerful option.  We have reviewed the genetic and neurobiological evidence on the commonalities among anxiety and depressive states in some detail elsewhere (Barlow, 2002, Chaps. 3, 6, 7, & 8; Bouton, 2005; Brown, 2007; Suárez et al., 2009). For example, most work on genetic contributions to anxiety and depression supports the early dictum of Ken Kendler (1996; Kendler et al., 1995), “same genes different environment” (Hettema, Neale, & Kendler, 2001; Rutter, Moffit, & Caspi, 2006). Consistent with a theory of an underlying genetic vulnerability, genetic variations have been linked to both trait anxiety and negative emotionality (or neuroticism) (Montag, Fiebach, Kirsch, & Reuter, 2011; Stein, Campbell-Sills, & Gelernter, 2009), and have been found to influence the later development of psychopathology following life stressors (Caspi et al., 2003). Recently, a growing body of literature in genetics has observed links between genetic polymorphisms and both the function and structure of neural pathways implicated in emotional processing, suggesting an association between a genetic predisposition, inefficient or maladaptive emotion processing, and the development of emotion disorders. For example, genetic variations have been associated with hyperactivation in neural structures implicated in emotion generation (Drabant et al., 2012; Lonsdorf et al., 2011; Munafò, Brown, & Hariri, 2008), reduced gray matter volume in limbic regions, and reduced functional connectivity between emotion-generating regions and structures implicated in their inhibitory control (Pezawas et al., 2005).  Increased perceptions of emotions as uncontrollable and intolerable, increased avoidant processing, and increased attempts at emotional control have also been demonstrated across disorders (Campbell-Sills, Barlow, Brown, & Hofmann, 2006a, 2006b; Weinberg & Hajcak, 2010; Weiser, Pauli, Weyers, Alpers, & Mühlberger, 2009). Intolerance of uncertainty and distress has been demonstrated across a full range of disorders, including depression, GAD, social anxiety, and OCD (Boelen, Vrinssen, & van Tulder, 2010; Bo    Emotional Disorders  swell, Thompson-Holland, Farchione, & Barlow, 2013; Lee, Orsillo, Roemer, & Allen, 2010). In addition, a growing number of studies have shown that individuals with anxiety and mood disorders tend to use maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, including attempts to avoid or dampen the intensity of uncomfortable emotions, that ultimately backfire and contribute to the maintenance of their symptoms (e.g., Campbell-Sills et al., 2006a, 2006b; Liverant, Brown, Barlow, & Roemer, 2008; Mennin, Heimberg, Turk, & Fresco, 2005; Tull & Roemer, 2007). Taken together, the evidence from genetics, neuroscience, behavioral studies, and psychopathology research suggests that a common, overlapping feature across disorders is the propensity toward increased emotional reactivity and inefficient or deficient regulatory control that is coupled with a heightened tendency to view these experiences as aversive and is manifest in attempts to alter, avoid, or control emotional responding.  In summary, the existing literature supports several arguments for stepping back from individual DSM diagnostic categories and associated disorder-specific psychological protocols, and considering a more unified transdiagnostic approach based on new findings on the nature of psychopathology and from the emerging field of emotion science. In addition, current evidencebased cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols for emotional disorders have much in common and reduce to three broad principles of change: altering emotionbased misappraisals of salient events; preventing avoidance of negative, emotionally charged internal or external triggers, as well as modifying emotion-driven behaviors (EDBs) and facilitating extinction of fear; and reducing anxiety and distress over the experience of intense emotion. A full explanation of this protocol and a description of its application with a patient follows.   treatMeNt variaBles  Setting  All assessments and treatments of patients are conducted in the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders (CARD) at Boston University. Our clinic receives over 500 new admissions per year, with many patients being offered treatment after their initial intake assessments. CARD, in addition to housing staff psychologists and a psychiatrist, is also a training center for doctoral  students and psychiatric residents. At any given time, numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH)–funded treatment and research studies are ongoing at the Center. Regarding diagnostic breakdown of treatmentseeking patients, the most common diagnosis assigned is GAD, followed by social phobia, PD/A, specific phobia, OCD, and PTSD, but the full range of “neurotic spectrum” disorders are assessed and treated. A small percentage of patients are assigned “coprincipal diagnoses,” which refers to cases in which two separate diagnoses are judged to be of equal severity.  Prior to the intake evaluation, each patient is mailed a packet of questionnaires to complete and bring to the assessment, which are scored and interpreted subsequent to the interview. The majority of the intake appointment comprises administration of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (for DSM-5 [ADIS-5; Brown, Di Nardo, & Barlow, 2014] or for DSM-IV [ADIS-IV; Di Nardo, Brown, & Barlow, 1994]). Following completion of the entire assessment process, consensus diagnoses are determined during a weekly staff meeting, after which the patient is provided diagnostic feedback and treatment recommendations. Based on the information from the interview, the patient may be offered one of several treatment options at the Center, or a referral in the community.  Format  Treatment with the UP is typically conducted in an individual format, although it has been successfully conducted in a group format with patients with mixed principal emotional disorder diagnoses. The treatment described in this chapter reflects the individual treatment protocol, which allows for greater attention to the description and application of treatment components during each session. However, when administered in a group setting, patients are easily able to see the commonalities among their diverse presenting complaints, and this understanding often creates a strong bond among group members. Therefore, it may be useful to adapt the protocol for group treatment as we have done at CARD.  Therapist Variables  The UP has been administered by therapists with varying degrees of clinical experience and expertise with the protocol. To our knowledge, both junior therapists (even therapists who have never had experience with   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  cognitive-behavioral treatments) and senior therapists (i.e., therapists with at least 4 or more years of treatment experience) have been able to adapt to the UP without significant difficulty. Certainly, a background in cognitive-behavioral techniques may be helpful when utilizing the protocol (e.g., facilitating cognitive reappraisal, and designing and conducting exposures). Evidence suggests some benefit to therapist experience, at least when treating PDA with a highly structured CBT protocol (Huppert et al., 2001).  The UP is an emotion-focused treatment approach; that is, the focus of every exercise is on eliciting and changing responses to a variety of emotions and emotional cues. Perhaps one of the most challenging aspects for the therapist is to be able to create and utilize emotion-provoking exposures effectively, which begin early in treatment and continue throughout its course. Most importantly, the therapist must have a sense of when a patient is avoiding the process of experiencing, expressing, or accepting emotions, and this is often signaled by very subtle behavioral cues, such as avoiding eye contact, changing the topic of discussion, arriving late for a session, and not completing (or “overdoing”) homework assignments. Each of these behaviors represents attempts to control uncomfortable emotions through either direct avoidance or overcontrol. It is essential that the therapist be able to recognize and address such behaviors when they occur, thereby allowing the opportunity for an effective emotion exposure and discussion of avoidance to facilitate emotional processing.   A second challenge for the therapist is to be able to tolerate and experience the expression of emotion by the patient. It is common for less experienced therapists to quickly “rationalize away” the patient’s emotional reactions; however, this only feeds into the cycle of emotions and avoidance. At every step, the therapist should encourage the expression and acceptance of emotion, while guiding the patient in how to “examine” it, without letting the emotion “take over.” In such cases, modeling from a senior therapist and/or extensive supervision may be helpful instruction for less experienced therapists in how to allow their patients to be “emotional.”  Client Variables  As previously mentioned, the rate of comorbidity among patients with a principal anxiety or mood disorder is approximately 55% (Brown, Campbell, et al.,  2001), depending on the principal diagnosis. In most CBT protocols, comorbid diagnoses are never a focus of treatment, although successful treatment of a principal anxiety disorder often results in decreases in comorbidity (e.g., Allen et al., 2010; Brown, Antony, & Barlow, 1995). One advantage of a unified treatment approach is that symptoms related to comorbid diagnoses can be discussed in treatment sessions and may even be the focus of an emotion exposure. For example, a patient with GAD who experiences chronic worry about daily matters may also feel anxious in social situations. Therefore, that patient’s in-session emotion exposure might comprise a conversation with a stranger or giving a speech to a small group of people. Contrary to traditional protocols, it is the experience of any emotion that is the target of treatment, which may be particularly beneficial for patients with significant comorbidity or for those who would like to address multiple concerns during the course of treatment.  Concurrent Drug Treatment  Many patients who present for treatment are also taking some form of psychoactive medication. At CARD, patients are required to have stabilized on the dosage of medication prior to the intake interview, so that the therapist has a clear picture of actual symptoms (as opposed to symptoms that may be caused by the initial addition or removal of a medication). Whereas concurrent use of medications such as tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) does not appear to have a negative impact on treatment outcome initially, once the medications are removed, evidence suggests that patients who received medication alone or CBT in addition to medication are more likely to relapse (e.g., Barlow, Gorman, Shear, & Woods, 2000; Heimberg et al., 1998; Liebowitz et al., 1999). The exact mechanisms underlying the return of symptoms are unclear, although some authors have suggested that patients may attribute the success of the treatment to the use of medication and, once it is withdrawn, no longer believe they have the ability to manage their symptoms. However, in a recent investigation using data from a multisite comparative study for the treatment of panic disorder, results indicated that patients who received CBT plus pill placebo were equally likely to believe they had received medication as patients who had actually received the medication (Raffa et al., 2008). Yet those in the CBT plus placebo condition were less likely to relapse compared to those who   Emotional Disorders  had received either CBT plus medication or medication alone. Therefore, it appears unlikely that the higher relapse rates in the medication conditions were due solely to this “attribution hypothesis.” One other hypothesis to explain greater relapse in patients receiving psychopharmacological treatment is that the medication provides an unintended “protective” effect against increased physiological arousal and anxiety. However, eliciting anxiety and panic is a core component of CBT protocols, so patients taking medication (1) may have experienced greater physical sensations when the medication was removed and/or (2) were never able fully to confront the physiological arousal and panic during the course of treatment. However, these hypotheses have yet to be fully investigated.  One additional consideration is the use of benzodiazepines on a p.r.n., or “as needed,” basis during the course of treatment. Following conceptions outlined in the UP, any strategy used to reduce the intensity of emotions in the moment is considered an emotional avoidance strategy, and ultimately contributes to increasing levels of anxiety and emotional reactivity. Therefore, the use of benzodiazepines (or other fast-acting medications) is discouraged, particularly if the medications are carried with the person as a “safety signal.”  assessMeNt  Case Study  Joseph is a 25-year-old, single man who, at the time of intake, worked as a freelance music teacher and an independent musician, occasionally performing his music at small local venues. Joseph came to our Center seeking help for long-standing, debilitating emotional issues that were standing in the way of his ability to attain personal and professional goals. Joseph reported a long history of struggles with anxiety and depression that were exacerbated and compounded by issues with his physical health.  During his intake interview, Joseph reported significant and oftentimes paralyzing social anxiety, describing significant fear of being evaluated negatively, and of others seeing him as a burden or “in the way.” This fear had caused him to avoid important social engagements throughout his life, such as birthday parties or other special occasions, and he often turned down invitations for casual gatherings at bars or at friends’ homes. He found himself becoming increasingly iso   lated because of this, and felt that some of his friends were “giving up” on him. In addition, his fears of being burdensome to others prevented him from asserting himself, which would often cause significant interference. For example, Joseph reported that he wanted to find a job as a music teacher for elementary schoolchildren, but asking others to provide information that was necessary for the completion of job applications, which was nearly impossible for him, would cause Joseph to miss deadlines or promising opportunities. Joseph noted that he has experienced social anxiety his whole life, but that it became more intense for him following a diagnosis of diabetes when he was 9 years old. He described always feeling like a burden on others since that time, and feeling like he was always “in the way.” Notably, these feelings extend even to walking down a public sidewalk—one of his most feared situations is inadvertently bumping into someone walking in the other direction, for fear that he has inconvenienced or caused that person to judge him negatively. Joseph reported that his social anxiety currently is more interfering than ever, as it is preventing him from finding work, and his social life is now “nonexistent.”  In addition, Joseph described significant embarrassment related to symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which had begun 5 years previously. Specifically, Joseph noted that he avoids any situation from which he cannot leave if he begins to experience stomach problems. He avoids eating all fruits or any type of food that might trigger bloating or loose bowels and reports that he wakes up 3 hours before he needs to leave for work in order to use the bathroom several times before leaving the house, in an attempt to avoid having any unexpected bowel movements while in public situations. He estimated using the bathroom up to five times each morning before leaving for work. In addition, Joseph reported that his fear of having an unexpected bowel movement has prevented him from traveling long distances in cars, attending movies or sporting events, or engaging in any activity where quick access to a restroom is not possible. He reported that his greatest fear related to these symptoms was that he would embarrass himself in front of others, either by becoming flatulent or losing control of his bowels altogether.  Joseph also described significant anxiety and worry about a number of different areas in his life. He worries about making small mistakes in his work, such as grammatical errors. He worries about his potential performance at work should he secure a teaching position, fearing that he would ultimately get fired from his   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  job for some mistake he might make. Joseph worries about his finances and being able to support himself, as well as about the health of his parents and their wellbeing. He also reported worrying about community and world affairs but noted that he controls these worries by “avoiding the news at all costs.” Joseph reports that his worries are difficult to control, and they interfere with his ability to concentrate. He feels restless, tense, irritable, and often has trouble sleeping when he worries. He noted that he spends about 90% of the average day worrying about something, and that these worries have interfered with his social life, his overall well-being, and his ability to find a job.  Joseph also described significant anxiety related to intrusive doubting thoughts, and thoughts that he might cause accidental harm to others. He described difficulty leaving his house in the morning for fear that he might inadvertently leave the stove on or the house unlocked, leaving his roommates vulnerable to fire or burglary. These thoughts drive him to check repeatedly to see that he has locked doors, extinguished candles, or turned off the oven and stove sufficiently, which can take up to an hour. Joseph also notably never received his driver’s license for fear that he might accidently run someone over or cause an accident while driving. He reported that his doubting thoughts and thoughts of accidentally causing others harm are extremely distressing to him and make him feel like he is an awful person who cannot be trusted.  Finally, Joseph reported feelings of depression and lack of interest in activities for the past year, since graduating from college. He often has difficulty sleeping at night and reports sleeping too much during the day. He experiences a feeling of “heaviness” and lack of energy, has difficulty concentrating on things. He experiences constant feelings of guilt and worthlessness, and has periodic thoughts of suicide, although he reported no plan or intent. Joseph reported that every few weeks he cuts himself on his legs and chest using a singleedged razor, in order to relieve tension and calm himself down. Joseph stated that although his feelings of depression are “bothersome,” he is also “used to them” because they have been present much of his life.  Objective assessment of Joseph’s emotional state via self-report questionnaires resulted in a score of 51 on the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; Mattick & Clarke, 1998), reflecting severe social anxiety; a score of 49 on the Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), reflecting severe depression; and a score of 80 on the Penn State Worry Ques   tionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer, Miller, Metzger, & Borkovec, 1990), reflecting moderate to severe levels of worry. His score on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; a modification of a scale introduced by Hafner & Marks, 1976) suggested that Joseph was experiencing severe interference in his life from these emotional symptoms. A diagnostic interview using the ADIS-IV revealed a principal diagnosis of social anxiety disorder at a clinical severity rating (CSR; described below) of 7, and additional diagnoses of GAD (CSR = 6), OCD (CSR = 5), and major depressive disorder (MDD; CSR = 5).  Interviews  A number of structured and semistructured clinical interviews may be appropriate for diagnosing Axis I disorders. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM- IV (SCID; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1996) is widely used and assesses diagnoses. Because this interview is highly structured and focuses only on current symptom count, it achieves a high degree of interrater reliability for many diagnoses. However, this interview does not include dimensional ratings of frequency and severity of symptoms, so it may be less useful for more detailed profiling of emotional disorders.  The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedules for DSM (ADIS-5; Brown, Di Nardo, & Barlow, 2014), a semistructured, diagnostic clinical interview, focuses on DSM diagnoses of anxiety, OCD and related disorders, and trauma- and stressor-related disorders and their accompanying mood states, as well as somatic symptoms and dissociative disorders, and substance and addictive disorders. The information derived from the interview using the ADIS allows clinicians to determine differential diagnoses and gain a clear understanding of the level and severity of each diagnosis. We refer to the updated DSM-5 version from this point forward. Principal and additional diagnoses are assigned a CSR on a scale from 0 (No symptoms) to 8 (Extremely severe symptoms), with a rating of 4 or above (Definitely disturbing/ disabling) passing the clinical threshold for DSM diagnostic criteria. Inquiries about suicidal ideation are part of this interview. The ADIS-IV has demonstrated excellent to acceptable interrater reliability for the anxiety and mood disorders (Brown, Di Nardo, Lehman, & Campbell, 2001).  Two additional clinician-rated measures that provide a wider range of scores are the (1) Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH    Emotional Disorders  A; Shear, Vander Bilt, & Rucci, 2001) and the (2) Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SIGH-D; Williams, 1988). The SIGH-A was developed to create a structured format for administering the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS; Hamilton, 1959). Respondents are asked to indicate the presence and severity of a number of symptoms that may have been present over the past week, including anxious mood, tension, sleep problems, irritability, and so forth. The rater is also asked to rate the interview behavior of the patient. The SIGH-A includes specific instructions on administration and anchor points for assigning severity ratings. This measure demonstrated good interrater and test–retest reliability (Shear et al., 2001). In addition, scores are similar to (although consistently higher than) the HARS.  Similar to the SIGH-A, the SIGH-D was developed to provide more specific instructions for administration and scoring of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; Hamilton, 1960). Again, patients are questioned about the presence and severity of a range of depressive symptoms over the past week, including depressed mood, suicidal ideation, fatigue, feelings of hopelessness, weight loss, and so forth. The SIGH-D also demonstrated good interrater and test–retest reliability, and produces scores similar to the HDRS (Williams, 1988).  Medical Evaluations  Medical evaluations are generally recommended prior to assignment of diagnoses and initiation of treatment to rule out organic causes for symptoms of emotional disorders. Some conditions, such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, mitral valve prolapse, or alcohol or substance withdrawal, may elicit symptoms similar to those associated with GAD or PDA. Although the diagnosis of such medical conditions does not preclude the need for a psychological treatment, it is generally recommended that such conditions be examined by a physician because an alternative treatment may be clinically indicated.  Self‑Monitoring  Self-monitoring forms are an important part of the treatment protocol for several reasons. First, the therapist is able to discuss specific situations or events that occurred over the past week and may have contributed to emotional reactions. Such records can facilitate dis   cussions of concepts presented during the treatment sessions and help the therapist integrate the general treatment components into the patient’s specific symptoms. Second, some evidence suggests that patients’ retrospective recall of past episodes of anxiety may be inflated, particularly when recalling panic attacks (Margraf, Taylor, Ehlers, Roth, & Agras, 1987; Rapee, Craske, & Barlow, 1990). Self-monitoring forms allow for a prospective, and possibly more accurate, account of anxiety episodes and may therefore be more useful therapeutically. In addition, consistent with the themes outlined in the UP, practicing awareness of emotions in the present moment is believed to be an important component of changing maladaptive patterns of emotional responding. The very nature of self-monitoring requires patients to disengage, even briefly, from the habitual anxious process to write down concrete thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, helping them to begin to adopt a more objective stance toward their own emotional experiences. Developing this habit will ultimately aid patients in beginning to change emotional reactions and resulting behaviors.  Treatment forms used in the UP include selfmonitoring forms for emotional awareness, automatic appraisals, emotion avoidance, as well as forms tracking interoceptive and situational exposure. Figure 6.1 illustrates the Monitoring Emotions and EDBs in Context (MEEC) form used in the UP. This form is given for several weeks at the beginning of treatment to begin to orient patients to tracking their own emotional responses. As new skills are introduced (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, changing EDBs), new self-monitoring forms typically replace the MEEC. For instance, once the skill of altering action tendencies associated with emotions is introduced, patients are asked to monitor situations, EDBs, and identify a new response incompatible with the original EDB on the Changing EDBs monitoring form (see Figure 6.2).  Several problems may arise with the introduction and completion of self-monitoring forms. First, some patients may not be compliant with completion of monitoring forms and homework assignments, which is an important issue to be addressed in the therapy session. Adopting a motivation enhancement approach, eliciting reasons underlying the patient’s ambivalence regarding completing the homework or monitoring can be a valuable technique (i.e., eliciting reasons why the patient might not wish to complete the homework and perceived benefits to not completing it). This process is crucial as it allows the therapist to identify maladaptive   A’sAntecedents R’sResponses C’sConsequences Date/Time Situation/Trigger Thoughts Feelings Behaviors What happened next?  figUre 6.1.

Changing EDBs monitoring form.  247   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  cognitive appraisals and emotional reasons contributing to the lack of completion of monitoring forms. Once such reasons are identified, therapeutic strategies such as cognitive reappraisal may also be used to increase patients’ willingness to complete homework forms by addressing some of the reasons for noncompliance raised by the patient. Furthermore, selectively reflecting the benefits of completing the homework and the costs associated with noncompliance can help to build motivation to complete homework forms. In some cases, especially when patient self-efficacy for completion is low, completion of homework forms themselves may become an emotion exposure, and progress toward this goal should be reinforced accordingly.  Another common problem with the completion of self-monitoring may be the tendency for some patients (particularly those with more obsessive or “perfectionistic” features, commonly seen in GAD and OCD) to “overdo” the homework forms; that is, the patient may write an extremely long and involved description of a situation and his/her reactions to it. This is common with patients who feel a need to “unload” every piece of information about the event. Although the patient is doing the homework, his/her overengagement may also be facilitating the anxious/worry process. If this becomes evident, the therapist may want to discuss the tendency to overengage in the homework as an emotional avoidance strategy (or as an EDB) and encourage patients to try to monitor situations and events using one- or two-word descriptions, or even implement a time limit to help ensure that patients do not spend lengthy periods of time generating their descriptions.   Questionnaires  In our research we employ a number of self-report questionnaires over the course of treatment. We describe most of them here, realizing that for purely clinical purposes only a subset would be needed. Two general (diagnosis nonspecific) questionnaires designed to measure symptoms and impairment associated with those symptoms are administered weekly prior to session to track symptoms and impairment across the course of treatment. A larger questionnaire battery is administered pre-, mid-, and posttreatment, and every four sessions during treatment, in order to gain a more comprehensive picture of patients’ presenting concern, as well as their overall functioning and quality of life. This battery comprises general questionnaires  (measures designed to assess a range of symptoms associated with anxiety and mood disorders, as well as disorder-specific measures designed to track symptoms associated with specific disorders).  Weekly General Measures  The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS; Norman, Cissell, Means-Christensen, & Stein, 2006), a brief, five-item questionnaire developed as a continuous measure of anxiety-related symptom severity and impairment, can be used across anxiety disorders, with multiple anxiety disorders, and with subthreshold anxiety symptoms. This measure has good internal consistency, excellent test–retest reliability, and convergent and divergent validity (Campbell-Sills et al., 2009; Norman et al., 2006). The Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS; Bentley, Gallagher, Carl, Farchione, & Barlow, 2013), a direct adaptation of the OASIS, is modified to be applicable for depression. It is a brief, five-item questionnaire that assesses dimensional depression-related symptom severity and impairment that can be used across depressive disorders, with varied comorbid presentations, and with subthreshold depressive symptoms. Both measures focus on severity of and impairment associated with particular symptoms over the past week, offering a general, diagnosis nonspecific measure designed to track changes as they occur over the course of treatment.   Additional General Measures  In the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule—Trait version (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), a brief, reliable, and valid measure of positive and negative affect, individuals rate how frequently they experience 20 feeling or emotion words in general. The PANAS assesses core negative affect and deficits in positive affect in those disorders with this characteristic (i.e., agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, depression) and is useful in determining changes in positive and negative affect over the course of treatment. In an effort to establish degree of interference from symptoms in various domains of living, the WSAS (Hafner & Marks, 1976) includes five items that ask participants to rate the degree of interference caused by their symptoms in work, home management, private leisure, social leisure, and family relationships. The WSAS, a descriptive measure of subjective interference in vari    Emotional Disorders  ous domains of living, has been successfully used in previous studies (e.g., Brown & Barlow, 1995).  Quality of Life and Well-Being Measures  The Quality of Life and Enjoyment Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ; Endicott, Nee, Harrison, & Blumenthal, 1993), a 14-item measure that assesses enjoyment and satisfaction across different life areas in the past week, is widely used and has been validated for use in clinical populations and shown to be sensitive to change (Endicott et al., 1993). The Mental Health Continuum—Short Form (MHC-SF; Keyes, 2005, 2006; Keyes et al., 2008; Lamers, Westerhof, Bohlmeijer, ten Klooster, & Keyes, 2011; Westerhof & Keyes, 2009) is a 14-item measure designed to assess social, emotional, and psychological well-being. The measure has shown excellent internal consistency and discriminant validity in both adolescents and adults in the United States, the Netherlands, and South Africa (Keyes, 2005, 2006; Keyes et al., 2008; Lamers et al., 2011; Westerhof & Keyes, 2009).  Diagnosis-Specific Measures  In addition to the general (diagnosis nonspecific) measures, it is important to assess symptoms specific to the individual’s specific diagnostic presenting concerns. We use the following measures that assess symptom severity over the past week and can be administered both as self-report and clinician-rated measures, increasing their clinical utility. The Yale–Brown Obsessive– Compulsive Scale–II (Y-BOCS-II; Storch, Larson, Price, Rasmussen, Murphy, & Goodman, 2010) is a revised version of the Y-BOCS (Goodman et al., 1989), designed to assess the presence and severity of OCD symptoms.  The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS; Shear et al., 1997), a seven-item scale, provides ratings of the core features of panic disorder (panic frequency, distress during panic, anticipatory anxiety, panic-related avoidance of situations and sensations) and the degree of work and social impairment/interference due to PD/A (Shear et al., 1997).  The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; Liebowitz, 1987) is a widely used 24-item scale designed to assess the range of social interaction and performance situations that patients with social anxiety may fear and/or avoid (Heimberg et al., 1999; Safren et al., 1999).  The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale (GADSS; Shear, Belnap, Mazumdar, Houck, & Rollman, 2006) is a six-item assessment that evaluates the core features of GAD.  The PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS; Foa, Riggs, Dancu, & Rothbaum, 1993) is a 17-item measure designed to assess DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. Each item, corresponding to the symptoms of PTSD, comprises one brief question that is rated from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (5 or more times per week/Very much). This measure yields a total PTSD severity score, as well as Reexperiencing, Avoidance, and Arousal subscores (Foa & Tolin, 2000).  Functional Analysis  Regardless of the diagnosis, a clear functional analysis of the patient’s behavior is essential prior to beginning treatment. Several components are important to consider when diagnosing a patient based on a functional analysis. These include a close examination of symptom topography (including duration of illness, physical sensations, level of distress and interference from symptoms), triggers (situations, physical symptoms, places, thoughts, etc.), cognitions (beliefs about symptoms and misappraisals), behavioral responses to emotions (including avoidance of situations, places, people, or triggers, as well as escape behaviors), and the consequences of behavioral reactions (limiting quality of life, reduced “comfort zone,” etc.).  Joseph, at the diagnostic level, met criteria for several distinct anxiety and mood disorders. His primary concern involved anxiety and avoidance of social situations due to fears of being judged or disliked by others. These fears had been present since Joseph was a young child and clearly fit with a diagnosis of social phobia. However, Joseph also experienced anxiety related to intrusive thoughts about causing potential harm to others. His intrusive doubting thoughts and thoughts of accidental harm to others, coupled with a number of compulsive checking behaviors, which took up at least an hour per day, were consistent with a diagnosis of OCD. Joseph also presented with significant anxiety and uncontrollable worry about his ability to perform well at work, his finances, and the health of his family, along with several associated physical symptoms. These worries, although involving social situations to some degree, also included more diffuse worries related to potential future negative outcomes. These worries were present even outside the context of a depressive   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  episode. Thus, an additional diagnosis of GAD was also assigned. Finally, Joseph’s reported symptoms of depression in the past year, along with accompanying lack of interest in activities, sleep difficulties, lack of energy, and poor concentration, resulted in a diagnosis of MDD.  Whereas Joseph’s symptoms merited the assignment of multiple co-occurring disorders, it is important to note that at the phenomenological level, these diagnosis-specific symptoms tended to interact and exacerbate one another, such that each disorder-specific cluster of symptoms was not necessarily occurring in isolation. This was an important consideration for treatment, and it provided a strong argument for a unified, transdiagnostic approach. For example, Joseph’s low self-esteem, driven by his depressogenic ruminations, fueled his sense of being “less than” and increased the perceived potential to be evaluated negatively by others. This anxiety focused on negative evaluation in turn increased Joseph’s more general anxiety and fueled his EDBs, for example, checking, which was often set in motion as a way to control a feared potential outcome of doing something wrong (checking locks to prevent loss of property), causing real harm to others (prevent fire by checking stoves, candles, etc.), or embarrassing himself in public (using the bathroom several times before work to prevent a flare-up of IBS symptoms). These anxieties were in turn congruent with his beliefs about himself as being “in the way” and a “bad person.” Joseph’s vigilance relative to his IBS symptoms was also fueled by anxiety related to negative evaluation, and an increased focus on his physical symptoms was usually coupled with increased levels of anticipatory anxiety. Joseph’s worries about potential future failures at work, his finances, and his family’s health were also congruent with a general belief that he would inevitably do something wrong and cause the “bottom to fall out,” or that some negative, unexpected outcome was always on the horizon. Joseph linked this sense of unpredictability and uncontrollability to his childhood diagnosis of diabetes, which also was his earliest memory of being “in the way.” He recalled several childhood incidents in which the adults in his life appeared “put out” by having to monitor his eating and insulin levels; he recalled developing a sense that he was a burden on others, although he recalled his sense of being “less than” developing much earlier on. Thus, all of these beliefs, behaviors, and physiological responses were interacting in Joseph’s emotional experiences, regardless of their specific diagnostic classification, and affecting  his ability to function in an adaptive way. Treatment of Joseph’s symptoms with the UP, which focuses on how the interactions of thoughts, feelings and behaviors at any given moment influence overall emotional experiences and subsequent actions, allowed us to target Joseph’s phenomenological patterns of dysfunction directly rather than focus on one diagnosis-specific cluster of symptoms at a time.  coMPoNeNts of treatMeNt  The structure of the UP outlines five core treatment modules and three additional modules, designed to be delivered in 12–18, 50- to 60-minute individual treatment sessions, held on a weekly basis. Final sessions may be held every other week to allow patients to consolidate gains and to provide somewhat of a “taper” off the weekly therapy. This format for the final sessions is not a requirement, though, and it may be more beneficial for the patient to continue to have weekly sessions if he/she might potentially have trouble using the treatment concepts consistently without the weekly reinforcement of sessions. Therefore, spacing of the final sessions is determined by the therapist, who takes into consideration the patient’s progress and any anticipated difficulties after treatment.  The five core treatment modules designed to target aspects of emotion processing and regulation are as follows: (1) increasing present-focused emotion awareness (Module 3); (2) increasing cognitive flexibility (Module 4); (3) identifying and preventing patterns of emotion avoidance and maladaptive EDBs (Module 5); (4) increasing awareness and tolerance of emotion-related physical sensations (Module 6); and (5) interoceptive and situation-based emotion-focused exposure (Module 7). Preceding these core components is a module focused on enhancing motivation and readiness for change and treatment engagement (Module 1), as well as an introductory module providing psychoeducation about the nature of emotions and a framework for understanding emotional experiences (Module 2). A final module reviews progress over treatment and develops relapse prevention strategies (Module 8). This treatment, which takes place in the context of provoking emotional expression (emotion exposure) through situational, internal, and somatic (interoceptive) cues, as well as through standard mood induction exercises, differs from patient to patient only in the situational cues and exercises utilized. In addition, “exposure” is not   Emotional Disorders  conceptualized as a mechanism of action. Rather, successfully provoking emotions creates a setting condition to implement the essential treatment components. Emotion exposures begin with general stimuli (e.g., mood induction and interoceptive provocation) and are later tailored to address each patient’s particular concerns and symptoms. Although each session addresses a specific component of the protocol, the expectation is that patients then “carry through” to future sessions the strategies they learn (e.g., patients learn cognitive reappraisal strategies in Module 4 but are expected to continue to use cognitive reappraisal throughout the remainder of treatment).  Module 1: Motivation Enhancement for Treatment Engagement  In this initial treatment module, which is grounded in the principles and therapeutic techniques utilized in motivational interviewing (MI; Miller & Rollnick, 2013), therapists work to increase the patient’s readiness and motivation for behavior change, and to foster a sense of self-efficacy, or the patient’s belief in his/ her ability to change. This module was included in the protocol in reaction to recent research by Westra and colleagues (Westra, Arkowitz, & Dozois, 2009; Westra & Dozois, 2006) suggesting that MI may enhance the efficacy of CBT for anxiety disorders. This module utilizes two specific motivational exercises: (1) a decisional balance exercise, in which the therapist works with the patient to identify and weigh the pros and cons of changing versus staying the same; and (2) a treatment goal-setting exercise that helps patients more clearly articulate achievable and concrete goals for treatment. This module, and the principles and techniques contained therein, are primarily used to help “set the stage” for subsequent learning that takes in the core modules. However, the principles can also be applied throughout the course of treatment to enhance treatment engagement and maintain patient motivation for behavior change.  Module 2: Psychoeducation and Tracking of Emotional Experiences  Following the initial motivation enhancement session, patients are provided with psychoeducation about the nature and function of emotions. This component is common to most CBT protocols, although the focus is expanded to include the function of many different  emotions (anger, sadness, etc.), in addition to the function of anxiety. In this module (which typically occurs over the course of one to two sessions), patients are provided information about the cognitive, physiological, and behavioral sequelae of emotional reactions and how these three components interact. It is important that the patient begin to consider that his/her reactions are functional and serve the purpose of providing information about the environment, in addition to protection from harm. This three-component model is then applied to a recent situation or event that the patient experienced, so that he/she may better understand the aspects of each component and how they interact. Patients also learn how to monitor and track more carefully their emotional responses and, as a result, are expected to develop greater awareness of their own patterns of emotional responding, including potential maintaining factors (e.g., common triggers and/or environmental contingencies).  Another important aspect of psychoeducation is the concept of negative reinforcement. Specifically, this is a detailed discussion of how the patient’s behavioral response to an emotional episode (usually escape or some form of emotional avoidance) is problematic because it reduces the emotion in the short term (i.e., by removing the person from the emotional stimulus) but reinforces the cycle of emotions in the long term (i.e., by teaching the person that escape/avoidance is the only way to manage these feelings in the future). It is extremely important that the patient understand the connection between behavioral responses and reinforcement of emotion, so that he/she is better able to appreciate the purpose and function of emotion exposures introduced in future sessions.  Module 3: Emotion Awareness Training  The first core module (which typically occurs over the course of one to two treatment sessions) is designed to help patients further identify how they are reacting and responding to their emotions by promoting a more nonjudgmental, present-focused approach to the experience of emotions. Often, patients report feeling that their emotions are confusing, or that they seem to just happen “automatically,” and/ or in such way that they are outside of the patient’s immediate awareness (i.e., “unconsciously”). Through this module, patients learn to become more aware of the interaction among thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and to view their emotions in a more objective and present-focused manner.   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  This occurs within the specific context of the situation in which the emotional experience is unfolding. The focus on present-moment experiences is important and is believed to put the patient in a better position to more clearly identify patterns of emotional responding and/ or the emotion regulation strategies being employed in the particular situation. In turn, this renders the patient better able to modify the emotional response adaptively to make it more consistent or compatible with ongoing situational or motivational demands. Furthermore, secondary reactions to the patient’s emotional experiences are also explored, and the therapist introduces the idea that it is not the emotions per se that are problematic, but rather how the patient reacts to the emotion. As these reactions tend to be judgment-laden (e.g., seeing anxiety as a sign of one’s inability to cope an indication of weakness, or a sign of failure) and are often not based on information from the present-moment context, they can prevent the processing of potentially corrective information that would allow for a change in the emotional response. It is expected that as patients develop a more nonjudgmental stance toward their emotions, they will be better able to identify the specific thoughts, physical sensations, and behaviors that may be contributing to their distress, and thus be in a better position to implement strategies for adaptively altering their emotional response. These skills are developed through the practice of brief mindfulness and emotion induction exercises.  Module 4: Cognitive Appraisal and Reappraisal (Increasing Cognitive Flexibility)  Cognitive therapy, initially developed by Aaron T. Beck to treat depression (Beck, 1967; Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; also discussed in-depth in Young, Rygh, Weinberger, & Beck, Chapter 7, this volume), has become a fundamental part of psychological treatments. Individuals with emotional disorders are likely to have appraisals and interpretations of external events that are characterized by cognitive biases, such as the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of the occurrence of negative events and to underestimate the ability to cope with these events. Thus, the aim of cognitive therapy is to evaluate objectively the likelihood of these negative appraisals and to incorporate more realistic, evidencebased appraisals of the outcome of a situation. On the surface, this technique may appear to be a way to suppress or control negative thoughts by “rationalizing”  them, and occasionally, this is how cognitive therapy is incorrectly used, as noted by Hayes, Strosahl, and Wilson (1999). However, this strategy can also be conceptualized from an emotion regulation perspective, especially if reappraisals are considered one of many possible interpretations of a situation.  The primary aim of this module is to foster greater flexibility in thinking (this module is typically administered in one or two sessions). This is accomplished first by helping patients develop an understanding of how they interpret or appraise situations, and how their appraisals influence patterns of emotional responding, then by teaching them to generate numerous alternative attributions and appraisals when experiencing strong emotional experiences. As their initial interpretations are typically more negative or anxious, patients are encouraged to be more flexible in their thinking (i.e., to generate alternative appraisals) and are taught reappraisal strategies.  As adapted in our usage, the UP focuses on correcting two fundamental misappraisals often found in individuals with emotional disorders: the probability of a negative event happening (probability overestimation) and the consequences if the negative event does happen (catastrophizing) (Barlow & Craske, 2007; Craske & Barlow, 2006). Although a number of other misappraisals are noted in other, traditional CBT protocols, most misappraisals can be condensed into one of the two appraisals listed here.  Module 5: Prevention of Emotion Avoidance and Modifying EDBs  Module 5 generally comprises one to two sessions. The concept of emotion avoidance is likely to be particularly important for patients who do not physically avoid or escape situations but still experience high levels of anxiety without much relief. The therapist should convey that even if the person stays physically in the situation, he/she is likely to engage in a number of other subtle behaviors to prevent full emotional arousal. In the UP, emotional avoidance strategies are behaviors that prevent the full experience of emotion in a situation, as opposed to EDBs, which are behavioral consequences of the experience of emotion (described later in the chapter). Any technique or strategy the patient uses to reduce or to down-regulate emotions may be conceptualized as an emotional avoidance strategy, and it is essential that emotional avoidance be identified and eliminated prior to engagement in emotion exposures,   Emotional Disorders  to allow for full emotional processing. Therefore, a very detailed description of individual emotional avoidance strategies must be obtained for each patient.  We have identified three general categories of emotion avoidance strategies: (1) subtle behavioral avoidance, (2) cognitive avoidance, and (3) safety signals (see Table 6.1 for examples). Subtle behavioral avoidance strategies may include a number of different behaviors, with certain behaviors occurring more frequently with particular disorders. For example, the avoidance of caffeine in panic disorder or social phobia (prior to a social engagement) is an attempt to keep physiological symptoms from becoming strong in anxiety-provoking situations. Patients with social phobia may also avoid eye contact or wear sunglasses when interacting in social settings. Individuals with GAD may excessively plan, prepare, or write “to do” lists in an attempt to control  potentially negative outcomes. At the same time, procrastination is also a form of subtle behavioral avoidance, if a particular task or project seems too emotionally arousing for the patient. It is very important to conduct a functional analysis of the subtle behaviors to determine which ones are avoidance strategies, that is, behaviors that serve to reduce or avoid emotional experience and are functional responses to situations. And, notably, what may be an avoidance strategy for one person may be a functional response for another. Cognitive avoidance strategies are typically more difficult to identify because they tend to occur outside of the patient’s awareness. Some of these strategies include distraction, “tuning out,” and mentally checking lists or reviewing past conversations. However, data also suggest that worry and rumination actually function as a way to down-regulate and avoid emotions (e.g., Borkovec,  table 6.1. examples of emotional avoidance strategies  Emotional avoidance strategy Disorder most usually associated  1. Subtle behavioral avoidance •• Avoid eye contact Social phobia •• Avoid drinking caffeine PDA •• Attempt to control breathing PDA •• Avoid exercise/physiological arousal (interoceptive avoidance) PDA/depression •• Avoid touching sink/toilet OCD •• Procrastination (avoiding emotionally salient tasks) GAD 2. Cognitive avoidance •• Distraction (reading a book, watching television) Depression/PDA •• “Tune out” during a conversation Social phobia •• Reassure self that everything is OK GAD •• Try to prevent thoughts from coming into mind OCD •• Distraction from reminders of trauma PTSD •• Force self to “think positive” Depression •• Worry GAD •• Rumination Depression •• Thought suppression All disorders 3. Safety signals •• Carry cell phone PDA/GAD •• Carry empty medication bottles PDA •• Hold onto “good luck” charms OCD •• Carry items that are associated with positive experiences GAD/depression (e.g., teddy bears, pictures) •• Have mace at all times PTSD •• Carry water bottle PDA •• Have reading material/prayer books on hand GAD •• Carry sunglasses or item to hide face/eyes Social phobia   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  1994). The function of worry is to enable the person to prepare for a possible threat. However, when someone experiences chronic worry and associated anxiety, his/her attention is focused on the future as opposed to the present moment. Research has shown that when confronted with an emotionally arousing event, chronic worriers do not experience the full emotional impact of that event because (1) they have been “bracing” themselves for something bad to happen, and (2) their focus has already shifted to other, future negative outcomes (Borkovec, Hazlett-Stevens, & Diaz, 1999). Therefore, the worry functions as a cognitive avoidance strategy and only serves as a maladaptive attempt to gain control over seemingly uncontrollable future events. Obsessions, common to individuals with OCD, may also function in a similar manner.  Safety signals are most common to patients with PDA, although may also be present in individuals with GAD, OCD, or other emotional disorders. Safety signals include any object that the patient carries to feel more safe or “comfortable,” particularly if he/she is entering an emotionally arousing situation. Safety signals can range from actual medication (e.g., benzodiazepines for reducing physiological arousal or medications for gastrointestinal distress) to empty medication bottles, to “lucky” objects (a talisman, teddy bear, “lucky” pen, etc.). Regardless of the object itself, if its function is to help the patient reduce emotional arousal in the moment, then it also is problematic because it feeds into the cycle of negative reinforcement.  In addition to changing patterns of emotion avoidance, this module also focuses on helping patients identify and subsequently change EDBs. Data and hypotheses from emotion science suggest that the most efficient and effective way to change emotions is by changing responses to them (Barlow, 1988; Izard, 1971); thus, it is conceivable that the mechanism of change during an exposure is to prevent the action tendency associated with a particular emotional experience. Over the past several decades, research has focused on these action tendencies, and changing action tendencies has become an important treatment component for anxiety, as well as other emotional disorders (Barlow, 1988; Linehan, 1993). For example, Beck and colleagues (1979) based a large part of their treatment for depression on changing the action tendencies of their patients to behave in a “passive, retarded, and apathetic manner” (p. 312). More recently, behavioral activation strategies have become a central feature of newer treatments for de   pression (Dimidjian et al., 2006; Jacobson, Martell, & Dimidjian, 2001); for a more in-depth discussion, see Dimidjian, Martell, Herman-Dunn, and Hubley (Chapter 9, this volume).  To distinguish action tendencies from avoidance strategies (described earlier), the UP has termed these behavioral responses to emotions as “emotion-driven behaviors” (EDBs). Whereas the function of emotional avoidance strategies is to down-regulate or suppress emotions, EDBs include a specific set of “reactive” behaviors associated with each emotion. For example, the EDB for a panic attack is escape (fight or flight), whereas that for anxiety is hypervigilance. Similarly, the emotion of anger elicits an EDB of attacking– defending, and the EDB for sadness is cognitive, emotional, and physical slowing and withdrawal (see Table  6.2 for examples of EDBs associated with different emotional disorders). It is important to note, however, that the therapist must focus on changing EDBs, in addition to preventing emotional avoidance. For example, a patient with social phobia may be able to maintain eye contact and fully engage in social situations but escape the situation when his anxiety rises to the level of panic. On the contrary, this same patient may be able to stay in the situation as long as needed, but he may be distracting himself the whole time or avoiding conversations with people. Clearly, both scenarios are problematic because the patient is preventing himself from learning that he can experience emotions at their fullest without leaving the situation. It should also be noted that, in practice, avoidance and EDBs may be difficult to distinguish, and this distinction can be downplayed with a given patient, if necessary or clinically relevant. After the concept of EDBs is introduced, patients begin to track EDBs on the self-monitoring forms and eventually focus on changing EDBs. This can be a very concrete exercise for the patient because he/she is instructed to “do something different than he/she would typically do.” The Changing EDBs monitoring form is illustrated in Figure 6.2.  Module 6: Awareness and Tolerance of Physical Sensations  This module (typically one session) was designed to increase patients’ awareness of the role of physical sensations as a core component of emotional experiences and to promote increased tolerance of these sensations.

Examples of IE exercises include hyperventilation, spinning (while standing and/ or in a chair), running in place, and breathing through a thin straw. The use of IE has largely been confined to the treatment of PDA, and has been shown to be effective in reducing panic attack frequency and the fear of physical sensations that occurs as a primary feature of the disorder (e.g., Barlow et al., 2000; Craske, Rowe, Lewin, & Noriega-Dimitri, 1997). However, given the fact that heightened physiological arousal, and sensitivity to physical sensations, is observed in other emotional disorders, IEs are applied across diagnoses, regardless of whether the physical sensations represent a specific focus of the patient’s anxiety.  Module 7: Interoceptive and Situational Exposures  In this final core module, treatment concepts are practiced and extended during in-session emotion expo   sures created by the therapist and individually tailored to the patient’s presenting symptoms (this module is the longest; typically lasting four to six sessions). Through exposure to both internal and external cues, patients ultimately increase their tolerance of intense and uncomfortable emotional experiences. In-session exposures can range from an imaginal exposure to a past emotional event (for PTSD or GAD), a conversation with a stranger (for social phobia), going into a dirty bathroom (for OCD), or watching a sad movie or movie clip (for MDD or dysthymia). Furthermore, for some patients, continued engagement in IEs may be indicated to promote greater tolerance of uncomfortable physical sensations. The goal of the exposures is gradually to introduce situations and experiences that serve as external triggers for emotional experiences. By eliciting the emotions that patients have been avoiding, they have the opportunity to practice the techniques taught in treatment (present-focused awareness, cognitive reappraisal, modifying EDBs, and prevention of emotion avoidance). In this sense, exposure to the emotion itself is the necessary mechanism of action for change. Thus, the actual situational context of the exposure becomes less important. Therapists must be creative in the design of the exposure to maximize the emotion provocation for the patient.   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  Module 8: Relapse Prevention  Treatment concludes with a general review of treatment principles and a discussion of the patient’s progress (usually one session). In this module, therapist and patient identify specific strategies for maintaining and extending treatment gains and for responding to future difficulties that may arise. For instance, it is emphasized that a return of anxiety and/or mood difficulties does not reflect relapse and, instead, may be a more natural fluctuation of emotions that can be addressed using the skills developed in treatment.  DetaileD DescriPtioN of Protocol  The following session descriptions and accompanying transcripts are from the case of “Joseph,” described earlier, treated by one of the authors (K. K. E).  Introduction: Overview of General Treatment Format and Procedures  During the introductory session, the goals of the treatment program are identified and reviewed. The UP aims to help clients become aware of and better understand emotional experiences and reactions, and to counter maladaptive responses to uncomfortable emotions. Modifying maladaptive responses can help reduce the intensity and frequency of uncomfortable emotions, while still allowing clients to experience them in an adaptive way. It is also important to emphasize that modifying these responses can be challenging, and that change often does not occur in a linear fashion.  Prior to the first treatment module, the therapist also provides a general introduction to treatment logistics, including general session length and structure, the role of therapist and client, and the importance of prioritizing treatment and completing out-of-session practice. The collaborative nature of treatment is emphasized, including the importance of feedback from the patient. Although the UP is ideally delivered in 12–18 sessions of 50–60 minutes each because the UP is based in a modular format, a flexible number of sessions can be used in each module, which may vary the total number of sessions across clients.  Following this introduction to treatment is a detailed review of the presenting complaint. In this review, the therapist focuses on the emotions that result in the most distress and/or interference in the patient’s life, the  situations and contexts in which those emotions occur, and how the patient has attempted to manage these emotions. Below, Joseph describes anxiety related to a new job opportunity:  tHeraPist: You mentioned you recently were offered an opportunity to teach over the summer. Can you tell me more about that?  JosePH: Well, I know I should be excited about it. It’s something I really want to do, teaching urban schoolkids music, but it’s stressing me out because I know I’m going to screw it up.  tHeraPist: How so?  JosePH: Well, in order to teach the class I need to schedule the classrooms and get supplies, but I don’t know who I’m supposed to talk to in order to arrange that, and I’m afraid if I send the person who hired me an e-mail, she is going to think I am stupid or incompetent, or that she made a mistake hiring me because I don’t know what I’m doing.  tHeraPist: And how are you coping with the anxiety now?  JosePH: Well, not very well, I think. I just feel like hiding, like this whole thing was a big mistake. I’m sort of hoping it will just work out somehow, but I don’t know how. I’ve been avoiding e-mailing her, but I haven’t talked to anyone else about it either. I keep waking up at night thinking about it, and it feels just like a pit in my stomach.  tHeraPist: So it sounds like it is also affecting your sleep?  JosePH: Yes.  tHeraPist: Have you come up with any solutions to your problem yet? JosePH: No, I just feel like a deer in the headlights right now, like I’m frozen, stuck. tHeraPist: Have you thought about asking someone else at the school for advice? JosePH: No way, I could never do that!  Note that in this early exchange, the therapist has already obtained important information about the patient’s emotional experiences and the ways in which he copes with uncomfortable emotions. In this case, Joseph is experiencing a great deal of anxiety related to a new job opportunity. The therapist is already gathering information about some of Joseph’s negative automatic   Emotional Disorders  appraisals (e.g., Joseph’s assumption that by asking for information or help, others will see him as incompetent), anxiety-related physical sensations (e.g., a “pit” in his stomach), and maladaptive behaviors (e.g., worry, rumination, avoidance, procrastination). The therapist is also able to elicit information about how helpful the patient’s current ways of responding to uncomfortable emotions are to him. In this case, Joseph is experiencing a great deal of anxiety but has been unable to come up with any solution to his problem, and is “frozen, stuck.”  Although the therapist will spend a significant portion of the session reviewing Joseph’s presenting complaints and gathering additional information about his responses to emotions, this process will continue across the first several treatment sessions. As the therapist obtains additional information about strategies (adaptive or maladaptive) for managing emotions, emotional or situational avoidance, and engagement in EDBs, this is then integrated into the patient’s functional analysis and the treatment plan may be adjusted accordingly.  Module 1: Motivation Enhancement for Treatment Engagement  This module focuses on achieving the goals of preparing and developing each patient’s willingness to make identified behavioral changes, based on the MI principals and techniques developed by Miller and Rollnick (2013). Specifically, the principles of (1) expressing empathy, (2) developing discrepancy, (3) rolling with resistance, and (4) supporting self-efficacy are used in this module and throughout the course of treatment to support behavior change. In this module, the therapist explores motivational issues with the patient, through exercises designed to build motivation (through the Decisional Balance Worksheet) and to enhance selfefficacy (using the Treatment Goal-Setting Worksheet). The aim of these exercises is to highlight potential obstacles to change, as well as to identify specific, concrete goals, respectively.  tHeraPist: Let’s take a look at your Decisional Balance Worksheet. You noted some pros for change, including being more social and working at a job you enjoy. What about some cons for change?  JosePH: Well, sometimes it’s easier just to avoid dealing with these situations altogether.  tHeraPist: Right, and it is important to note and be  honest with yourself about this because there is part of you here that wants to change, and another part that has learned that, at least in the short-term, it’s easier to just stay the same. What about cons for staying the same?  JosePH: Well, if I don’t ever face my anxiety, I might not ever get to have a social life, or the job I want.  tHeraPist: So, on the one hand, you want to change how you deal with your anxiety so that you can have the life you want, and at the same time, this change is harder than just avoiding?  JosePH: Yes, that’s right.  tHeraPist: Acknowledging both of these parts of yourself is important because it is actually quite normal to have some apprehension or ambiguity about change. By being open with yourself about this, you are in a much better position to weigh out your decision whether or not to engage in treatment because it will be about weighing out a choice rather than judging yourself for success or failure. If you find yourself wavering during treatment, you will be able to recognize that this may be related to your feelings of apprehension or ambiguity about change, which is quite normal, and not because you are necessarily failing in some way.  Module 2  Understanding Emotions  The therapist begins this module by providing psychoeducation about the nature of emotions and how they become disordered. It is important to highlight the functional, adaptive nature of emotions at the onset of this discussion for two reasons: (1) so the patient can understand why he/she would not simply want to eliminate emotions and (2) to explore the potentially important information provided by adaptive emotions. This second point is illustrated by the introduction of EDBs (behaviors that occur in response to emotions), so that the patient can see how emotion motivates specific responses to internal or external events or situations.  Next, the three-component model of emotional experiences is described as a framework for examining emotions by dividing them into components (cognitions, behaviors, and physiological sensations), thereby making them more manageable. The therapist uses an example relevant to the patient’s experience to demonstrate the contribution of each component to his/   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  her emotional experience. The therapist guides the patient in identifying each component in this example and presents the model as the structural basis for treatment. Each component is addressed separately over the course of treatment as contributing to the overall emotion and interacting with the other components. For homework in this section of the module, the patient is asked to complete a three-component model example in which he/she is asked to break down an emotion from the week into the three-component model presented in session, by recording the thoughts, behaviors, and physiological sensations specific to that example.  tHeraPist: As we talked about, emotions at their core, even ones like anxiety, fear, anger, or sadness, are actually good things because they help us to function, and help us to navigate the world around us. The thing is, though, we also have reactions to our emotions. An emotion can trigger all sorts of associated thoughts, memories, physical sensations, and behaviors, oftentimes learned over a lifetime. The problem is, when we experience all of that at once, it can feel overwhelming, and we can get caught up in our emotional responses, and all of sudden these emotions feel like something we can’t cope with, that we have to get away from. Suddenly, the anxiety you feel about your new job isn’t functioning as a helpful way to motivate you to prepare for the future, which is, at its core, the adaptive function of anxiety. Instead, the anxiety is something paralyzing, something that is waking you in the night and making you feel “frozen.”  JosePH: Right, and I just want it to go away.  tHeraPist: Right. Instead of feeling helpful and useful, the emotion feels intolerable. So what we need to do is break down these emotional experiences into their component parts to help make them less overwhelming, and to help us identify how an emotion like anxiety goes from something adaptive and useful to something feared and avoided. As I mentioned, emotional experiences are made up of three main parts: thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. What we need to do is get you better at recognizing each of these parts, to make you a better observer of your emotional experiences. Then, throughout treatment, we’ll take a closer look at each of these components individually, to see how specific thoughts, feelings  or physical sensations, and behaviors might be influencing your overall experience and causing the experience to go from something helpful and useful to something uncomfortable and unwanted.  Recognizing and Tracking Emotional Responses  An important step to gaining greater understanding of emotional experiences involves more closely monitoring when, where, and why the emotions are occurring. This is done through illustration of the ARC of emotions. In this illustration, it is critical that the therapist clearly work through an example with the patient, focusing on several important points. First, emotions are always triggered by some event or situation (internal or external), even though it may be difficult to identify that trigger initially. However, with repeated practice and awareness, it can get easier to identify specific triggers, and those are known as antecedents (“A” in ARC of emotions). Antecedents can occur immediately before the emotion is experienced (e.g., going into an elevator triggers a panic attack), or they may have occurred days or even longer before the emotion is experienced (e.g., an argument with a friend earlier in the week triggering an outburst at a loved one later on). Often, there are multiple antecedents, and may be both immediate and distal. The “R” of ARC of emotions is all responses to emotional experiences, including the thoughts, physiological sensations, and behaviors noted in the threecomponent model. Finally the consequences, or “C” of ARC of emotions, signify the short-term and/or longterm results of emotional responding. Consequences are often negative, but it is important that the therapist point out potential positive consequences of emotional responding (e.g., reduction in anxiety after escaping a difficult situation), as this process of negative reinforcement is usually maintaining the cycle of emotions.  Expanding on this discussion, the therapist now introduces the concept of learned behaviors, essentially focusing on how the patient has learned responses to emotions that are usually an attempt to manage or control the emotions, but often end up leading the patient to feeling worse. Habitually responding to emotions prevents any new learning from taking place (i.e., that a situation is not as dangerous as it appears during the experience of a panic attack) and disables the patient from developing a way of coping. This process is what makes adaptive emotions and emotional responses maladaptive.    Emotional Disorders  Module 3: Emotion Awareness Training— Learning to Observe Experiences  The goal of this module is to introduce the patient to the concept of emotion awareness and begin developing a regular practice of this skill. The therapist must convey that the emotion awareness skill is different than the patient’s current sense of his/her emotions. This skill allows the patient to see emotions from an objective and nonjudgmental perspective in order to better identify and alter maladaptive thoughts and behaviors. During this introduction, the therapist reviews the difference between primary emotions, which are the “first” emotional responses to a situation and memory (usually directly related to the situation or memory itself) and secondary reactions, which are reactions to primary emotions that tend to be judgment-laden and not based on the present-moment context. Secondary reactions are problematic because they can prevent receipt of corrective information about the current situation. Additionally, secondary reactions are typically evaluative and critical in nature, which further distances the patient from the potentially helpful or corrective information provided by the current situation or primary emotions, and tend to intensify or prolong the emotional experience. Using personal examples from the patient’s own experience to describe both primary emotions and secondary reactions can be very helpful in this discussion.  When reviewing present-focused awareness, it is important that the therapist remind the patient of several important points. First, this type of practice may feel awkward or uncomfortable at first. The goal is not to be “perfect” at the exercise; rather, the patient should focus on becoming an objective observer of emotional experience, and start developing the ability to pay attention mindfully and in the moment. Second, informal, present-focused awareness practice is also important. The therapist can help the patient find a “cue” (e.g., the breath) to shift focus to the present moment, particularly in times of distress. The goal of this more informal practice is repeatedly to pair the patient’s chosen cue with a shift in attention and awareness to the present moment, by focusing on a sight, sound, or other sensation, so that engaging this cue will eventually be automatically paired with present-moment awareness. It is important that the therapist note that the breath (or other cue) should not be used as distraction—it should only be used as a cue to remind the patient to be mind   ful of the present moment. Eventually, once the patient has successfully conditioned this cue to help refocus on the present moment, the patient can learn to follow this with a brief “three-point check” of thoughts, physical sensations, and behaviors. By observing what is occurring in the moment within these three domains, the patient can begin to identify how responses in any of these domains may be affecting the overall emotional experience, to compare what is happening in these domains with information from the current context, and ultimately to identify and alter any maladaptive patterns of responding.  These concepts are illustrated in session with the use of a specific nonjudgmental emotion awareness practice during formal mindfulness or awareness exercise. This may be a guided meditation or some other practice that allows the patient to focus on the present moment, while he/she notices and practices letting go of judgments and evaluation. After the patient has had a chance to practice this skill, the next practice involves using the skill to notice slightly stronger emotional experiences. It is often helpful to have the patient identify a salient piece of music to listen to in session; otherwise, the therapist can select a piece of music. At the conclusion of the music, the therapist helps the patient elicit thoughts, feelings, or other reactions and practice discussing this experience in an objective and nonjudgmental way. The following excerpt describes Joseph’s reaction to listening to a piece of music:  tHeraPist: What did you notice when you were listening to the music?  JosePH: I noticed my mind was sort of jumping from  place to place. That was hard—observing my  thoughts.  tHeraPist: Although, it sounds like you were able to notice that your thoughts were jumping around a bit and hard to pin down. Since the goal of this exercise is to practice observing, even just noticing your thoughts have taken you somewhere else, even after it has already happened, counts. What about physical sensations—did you notice any of those?  JosePH: I noticed when one of the instruments came in, I sort of felt it in my gut.  tHeraPist: So just hearing that new sound brought about a physical sensation?  JosePH: Yes.   CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  tHeraPist: And what about behaviors, did you notice any behaviors, or any urges to do something? JosePH: Well, I noticed a couple of times just feeling uncomfortable and sort of wanting to move around.  tHeraPist: And what about the music itself, were you able to listen to the music itself? JosePH: I think I was more sort of lost in my head.  tHeraPist: This is what our emotions can do. An emotion can trigger all sorts of associated thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that have very little to do with what is happening “in the room,” yet the initially triggered emotion itself is connected to something occurring in the present moment, just like the music you were listening to, which was really just sounds happening in the present moment. Getting better at observing our reactions to the trigger (in this case, the music), can help us to see how many of our associated thoughts, feelings, and behaviors actually “fit” with the current context, and how many of them are just associations, which may or may not fit the current context at all.  Module 4: Cognitive Appraisal and Reappraisal  Cognitive appraisal first involves discussing the concept that interpretations depend, in large part, on which of the numerous aspects (or stimuli) a person chooses to focus on in any given situation. Focusing only on limited or specific aspects of a situation is critical for our survival. We would be overwhelmed by information if we focused on all stimuli everywhere we went. This process helps us quickly evaluate situations for risk and danger, and allows us to estimate what might happen in the future. This process usually happens outside of awareness. Importantly, the information we focus on and what we perceive as risky or dangerous tends to be the result of learned associations between specific information or stimuli and the affective or threat value of those stimuli. For example, if negative evaluation by others has been associated with threat in the past, an increase in vigilance for negative evaluation may result. Importantly, appraisals can have a powerful impact on our feelings or mood states, and vice versa. The therapist can illustrate this concept by inquiring how appraisals might vary depending on whether the patient was feeling joyful, sad, or angry.  An in-session exercise is used to demonstrate the many possible different appraisals that can be gener   ated from a situation. The therapist shows the patient an “ambiguous” picture to which many cognitive appraisals can be assigned, instructs the patient to look at the picture for approximately 30 seconds, then elicits both the patient’s initial appraisal and at least two or three alternative appraisals. Additionally, the patient is asked what specifically may have contributed to the automatic appraisal (e.g., memories of similar situations, specific details in the picture). This exercise is used to demonstrate the way that situations can be interpreted in many ways, if all available information is considered.   Automatic appraisals, interpretations of situations that happen very quickly, are often negative or pessimistic in nature. Core automatic appraisals (e.g., “I am a failure”) are appraisals that may be driving many emotional responses. It is helpful if the therapist can identify one or more core automatic appraisals by using the downward arrow technique instead of focusing only on surface-level appraisals related to a specific situation.   Automatic appraisals can lead to a habitual and powerful heuristic that begins to exclude other, possibly more appropriate or realistic appraisals of a situation or event. These automatic appraisals are called “thinking traps,” because, over time, a patient may get “stuck” in this way of thinking. As described earlier, two common thinking traps, “probability overestimation” (jumping to conclusions), or the tendency to assume a high likelihood of the occurrence of a negative event, and “catastrophizing” (thinking the worst), or assuming that the consequences of an event will be beyond the individual’s ability to cope, are presented as two cognitive biases common to all emotional disorders. The therapist guides the patient in beginning to identify these biases in the context of his experience. Below, the therapist discusses both of these cognitive biases based on a recent situation in which Joseph was nearly hit by a car while crossing the street.  tHeraPist: Tell me what happened when you were nearly hit by the car.  JosePH: Well, I was crossing the street, and a car made an illegal right turn and nearly ran me over. My hands hit the hood of her car, and I could see the driver’s face yelling at me.  tHeraPist: And what happened next?  JosePH: Well, I noticed people on the sidewalk were all looking at me like I was a complete idiot, and I was   Emotional Disorders  so embarrassed I just ran home. I didn’t go out for the rest of the day, I just couldn’t face anyone.  tHeraPist: Can you remember any of your thoughts at the time?  JosePH: I just remember feeling like an idiot, like everyone was just staring at me and thinking what a jerk I am.  tHeraPist: You mentioned you were crossing at a crosswalk—was the walk sign on to cross?  JosePH: Yes.  tHeraPist: And the driver, you mentioned the driver was taking an illegal turn?  JosePH: Yes, there was a “No turn on red” sign.  tHeraPist: So you had the right of way?  JosePH: I guess so.  tHeraPist: Let’s go back to the reaction of the people on the sidewalk—you said they were staring at you, thinking you were an idiot?  JosePH: It seemed like it.  tHeraPist: What evidence did you have to suggest the pedestrians thought you were an idiot?  JosePH: I don’t know, they were just looking at me and pointing and frowning.  tHeraPist: Do you know for certain that was what  they were thinking?  JosePH: Well, not for certain.  tHeraPist: Exactly, because we actually don’t know what they were thinking. So one possibility is they thought you were an idiot, but can you think of any other possible thoughts that might have been going through their minds? If you were standing on the sidewalk and saw someone almost get run over in a crosswalk, what might some of your thoughts be?  JosePH: Well, I guess I might be sort of alarmed, or hoping the person was OK.  tHeraPist: If you saw someone crossing the street and they had the right of way and were nearly hit by a car making an illegal turn, how likely do you think it would be that you would be thinking that person is an idiot?  JosePH: Not very likely, I would probably be more concerned.   tHeraPist: But for you, at that moment, how much did it feel like that’s what the pedestrians were thinking  about you, that you were an idiot, on a scale of 0% or not at all to 100% certain.  JosePH: At that moment? Probably 80–90%.  tHeraPist: And sitting here now, how likely do you think it is that the pedestrians were thinking you were an idiot, using the same percentage scale?  JosePH: I don’t know, maybe 20%?  tHeraPist: And at the time, what emotions were you experiencing?  JosePH: Well, when she almost hit me, I think I felt fear.  tHeraPist: Can you remember any physical sensations?   JosePH: I think my heart was racing, and I remember feeling hot and shaky.  tHeraPist: So when you were experiencing fear, and all of the associated physical sensations, the thoughts that came with that was that others perceived you as an idiot, in the wrong. And at the time, these thoughts felt like they were true. Now, sitting here, without the experience of fear or the associated physical symptoms, how likely do those thoughts feel?  JosePH: Well, sitting here now, it doesn’t seem very likely they would be thinking I was an idiot if I almost got run over. It seems sort of extreme.  The therapist discusses the importance of monitoring and recording automatic appraisals, in order to increase the patient’s awareness that these automatic appraisals are occurring, and reminds the patient that using the present-focused awareness skills learned in the previous module can help aid in this process—by anchoring in the present moment using the patient’s chosen cue (i.e., taking a deep breath and focusing attention on a sound or sensation occurring in the present moment), the patient can use the “three-point check” to observe what thoughts are occurring at that moment. The goal is to notice what automatic thoughts are occurring, then, using information from the current situation, consider other possible interpretations of what is occurring within the current context. In this way, the patient can more flexibly apply information from learned associations (i.e., memory) and information from the current context toward more adaptive appraisals.  As the patient begins to record automatic appraisals, the therapist can help him/her begin to identify patterns in the automatic thoughts. The therapist provides guid    CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers  ance on identifying thinking traps and tries to focus the patient’s attention on the “core” appraisal through the use of “downward arrow” Socratic questioning. The excerpt below is from a discussion of Joseph’s fears of having a flare-up of his IBS symptoms and needing to use the bathroom in the middle of a party.  tHeraPist: You’ve talked about how your IBS symptoms have kept you from going to parties. What specifically concerns you about your IBS symptoms and parties?  JosePH: Well, that I’ll be there at a party and all of a sudden I’ll have to run to the bathroom.  tHeraPist: And what concerns you about that?  JosePH: Well, people will notice me rushing to the bathroom.  tHeraPist: And what?  JosePH: And they’ll know I’m in there using the bathroom.   tHeraPist: And what concerns you about that?  JosePH: They’ll think I’m disgusting.  tHeraPist: And what does that mean to you?  JosePH: That I’m gross and worthless. No one will want anything to do with me.  tHeraPist: Now that is what we want, the real core of it, what is driving this interpretation. A lot of these anxious thoughts you’ve recorded often do come down to feeling worthless. So you think, “If I can’t control my bowels, I am going to have to use the bathroom, and if I have to use the bathroom people are going to reject me as disgusting and worthless.” Of course, anyone would be anxious about going to a party with that type of appraisal.  As demonstrated earlier, the therapist then engages the patient in a more detailed discussion of this core cognitive reappraisal, focusing on flexible thinking. Countering probability overestimation and decatastrophizing strategies are presented as a way to generate alternative appraisals and to place less focus on the automatic appraisal. Countering probability estimation involves drawing on past evidence to examine how realistic the patient’s estimation is when experiencing an emotion. The therapist guides the patient in making concrete estimations and comparing the original estimation to a more realistic one. Decatastrophizing involves helping the patient to identify his/her ability  to cope with the feared situation using past evidence and specific examples (e.g., similar experiences in the past). It is important to communicate that these strategies do not eliminate negative appraisals, but they provide greater flexibility and allow the patient to gain perspective on the feared situations, using more accurate information as a guide rather than being caught up in overlearned automatic appraisals.  Module 5
