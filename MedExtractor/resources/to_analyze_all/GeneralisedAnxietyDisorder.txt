Symptoms - Generalised anxiety disorder in adults

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) can affect you both physically and mentally.

How severe the symptoms are varies from person to person. Some people have only a few symptoms, while others have many more.

You should see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress.
Psychological symptoms of GAD

GAD can cause a change in your behaviour and the way you think and feel about things, resulting in symptoms such as:

    restlessness
    a sense of dread or fear
    feeling constantly "on edge"
    difficulty concentrating
    irritability

Your symptoms may cause you to withdraw from social contact (seeing your family and friends) to avoid feelings of worry and fear.

You may also find going to work difficult and stressful, and may take time off sick. These actions can make you worry even more about yourself and increase your lack of self-esteem.
Physical symptoms of GAD

GAD can also have a number of physical symptoms, including:

    dizziness
    tiredness
    a noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)
    muscle aches and tension
    trembling or shaking
    dry mouth
    excessive sweating
    shortness of breath
    stomach ache
    feeling sick
    headache
    pins and needles
    difficulty falling or staying asleep (insomnia)
