Problem Solving (Sessions 15–18)

FFT sessions were held less frequently (biweekly) in
the fourth, fifth, and sixth months. At Session 15, problem
solving was introduced. After explaining the rationale,
the therapists asked the couple to identify several
specific problems for discussion, then reviewed the
problem-solving steps with them.

The first issue chosen by the couple seemed superficial
at first. They had two cats, one of which belonged
to Debra (and had come with her from a previous marriage)
and the other of which Barry had bought. They
disagreed on how much the cats should be fed: Debra
“wanted mine to be fat” and fed it frequently, whereas
Barry wanted his to be thin. As a result, Barry’s cat was
waking them up in the middle of the night, needing to
be fed. The resulting changes in Debra’s sleep–wake
cycles had resulted in her becoming irritable, restless,
and possibly hypomanic. Despite a conscientious literature
search, the therapists were unable to find any
research on the influence of cat diets on the cycling of
bipolar disorder.

The couple considered various alternatives: feeding
the cats equal amounts, keeping Barry’s cat in the
garage, giving away Barry’s cat, and feeding both cats
before the couple went to bed. They eventually settled
on the last of these. The problem itself generated humor
and playfulness between them, and they derived some
satisfaction from being able to deal with it collaboratively.


A second and potentially more serious source of
conflict concerned their night life. Both liked going to
parties, but Barry liked to stay longer than Debra, who
thought that parties contributed to her mood cycling.
She tended to become overstimulated by the interactions
with many people and would quickly become
fatigued. They considered several alternatives: going
to the parties in separate cars, Barry agreeing to leave
earlier, Debra going to the car and sleeping when she
felt tired, and Debra taking a cab home. They eventually
decided to discuss and agree upon a departure time
before going to a party.

The couple was able to apply the problem-solving
method successfully to other issues, such as paying
the bills and helping Jill get to her afterschool activities.
They continued to have trouble breaking problems
down into smaller chunks, and tended to “crosscomplain”
or bring up larger problems in the middle of
trying to solve smaller ones. Barry often complained,
“We aren’t dealing with the source of these problems,

which is her bipolar disorder. We wouldn’t have these
problems if she weren’t bipolar.” Again, the therapists
did not challenge his definition of the problem, but continued
to offer the message that regardless of whether
the source of the problems lay in Debra, the couple still
needed to work collaboratively to generate acceptable
compromises.

Termination (Sessions 19–21)

By 7 months, Debra, whose depression had largely
remitted, had obtained a new job working in sales at
a clothing store. The therapists began the termination
phase of treatment, which focused on reviewing what
the couple had taken away from the psychoeducation,
CET, and problem-solving skills modules. Both reported
that their relationship had improved, and that they
“occasionally” used the communication skills at home.
The therapists commented on how far they had come
and encouraged them to pick a time each week to meet
and rehearse one or more of the skills.

Barry was not entirely convinced of Debra’s clinical
improvement, however. In one of the final sessions, he
returned to the issue of Debra’s symptoms and her “unwillingness”
to follow through on tasks such as cooking,
depositing her paycheck, cleaning Jill’s clothes,
and doing other tasks they had agreed she would perform.
The following interchange ensued:

Barry: (Laughs nervously.) I had this dream the other
night that I was getting married, and I knew that I
was marrying Debra, but I couldn’t see her face, and
I wasn’t sure it was really her. And I wasn’t sure if I
should be there.

tHeraPist 1: And you were standing in front of everyone
wearing your pajamas as well.

Barry: (Laughs.) Yeah, and I was about to take the
exam that I hadn’t studied for. But really, sometimes
I feel like she’s not the same person, especially when
she doesn’t want to follow through on things we’ve
talked about.

tHeraPist 1: Let me give you some perspective on
this. I think a dilemma many spouses face is “Should
I stick it out with my husband or my wife, or should
I leave and take care of me?” There are certainly
people who do that, who leave, and then there are
many others who hang out and wait for things to get
better, which in fact they often do.


Bipolar Disorder

Barry: And I think things have gotten better.

DeBra: I think so. I don’t know why you’re being so
negative.

Barry: Well, if you. . .

tHeraPist 1: (Interrupts.) Let me finish this thought.
Barry, I think it’s critical for you to make a distinction
in your own mind between what Debra can and
can’t control. That’s sometimes vague between the
two of you. When you say she doesn’t want to follow
through, that certainly sounds like an intentional
behavior—something she’s doing to hurt you or
annoy you. Debra, do the problems with following
through ever feel like they’re about problems with
your concentration? Your attention or your memory?

DeBra: (nodding emphatically) Absolutely! If you
could get him to realize that, we’d be a lot farther
along.

Barry: That memory stuff—is that her bipolar disorder
or her attention deficit disorder?

tHeraPist 1: I’m not sure that’s really the question.
That’s just a diagnostic distinction, and I’m not sure
my answering one way or the other will help you.
Maybe what you’re really wondering is whether
these problems are controllable by her or not. If I
were in your position, the things that would really
anger me would be those things I thought she was
doing intentionally.

Barry: Yeah, and I don’t always think about that.

tHeraPist 1: If I thought what she was doing was due
to a biological dysregulation, I might be more patient,
more sympathetic—in the same way that if someone
had a broken leg and had trouble walking up stairs, I
might have more sympathy than if I thought she was
deliberately trying to hold me up.

In this segment, the therapist was addressing directly
what he felt was a major source of Barry’s critical attitudes
toward Debra: the belief that many of her negative
behaviors were controllable and intentional (Hooley &
Licht, 1997; Miklowitz et al., 1998). In some instances,
Barry may have been right about Debra’s motivations.
But questioning the controllability of her symptoms
forced him to consider a different set of causal explanations
for her behavior. The distinction between controllable
and uncontrollable behavior is a key point in
the psychoeducational treatment of families of patients
with bipolar disorder.

Barry and Debra’s Progress

After completing FFT, Debra continued to have mild
periods of depression despite her adherence to medication.
Her depressions were unpleasant but not so
severe that she was unable to keep her job or attend
to her parenting duties. Her brief hypomanic periods
sometimes caused arguments between Debra and
Barry but were not debilitating. Barry and Debra were
communicating better, and both agreed that Barry
was more patient and less critical of her. But Debra
frequently found herself reacting with the line from
the now famous movie, “What if this is as good as
it gets?” Although she was functional, she expressed
chagrin that she could not have the life she had wanted—
a successful career, a more intimate relationship
with her husband, more friendships, an easier relationship
with her daughter, and more financial success.
The reality of her disorder and its psychosocial effects
were difficult for her to accept. However, Debra felt
that FFT had been helpful, as had her medication,
which she showed no inclination to discontinue. The
therapists offered her a referral for individual or group
therapy, but Debra decided to forgo further psychosocial
treatment for the time being. Barry was given the
name of a local DBSA group for spouses of persons
with mood disorders.

coNclusioNs

Family psychoeducational treatment appears to be a
useful adjunct to pharmacotherapy. However, not all patients
with bipolar disorder have families, and individual
or group treatment approaches are important alternatives
to consider. The finding that mood-stabilizing
medications are more powerful in alleviating manic
than depressive symptoms, whereas the reverse may be
true for psychotherapy, is an argument for combining
medical and psychosocial interventions in the outpatient
maintenance of bipolar disorder.

There is limited research on which families are the
best candidates for FFT. In several of our trials, patients
in high-EE families have shown greater reductions
in mood severity scores over 1–2 years than those
in low-EE families. But reductions in relapses have
been observed in patients from both high- and low-EE
families treated with FFT. Our clinical observations
also suggest that there are subgroups of patients who
do not respond well to FFT. Specifically, patients who


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

are unusually resistant to accepting the diagnosis of
bipolar disorder often resent the educational focus of
FFT. These patients usually see their troubles as having
external origins (i.e., being mistreated by others)
and resist interventions that require them to take more
responsibility for their behavior. These patients may
also reject pharmacotherapy. Sadly, we have seen many
patients go through several hospitalizations before the
reality of their disorder sets in.

A different kind of resistance originates from viewing
the disorder as biologically based. Some patients
prefer to limit their mental health contacts to a psychiatrist
for medication, and regard psychotherapy as irrelevant.
We see nothing wrong with this position; a subset
of patients does function well on medication only.
Future research needs to determine whether this selfselected
group is different from patients who request
psychotherapy, in terms of symptomatic, course-ofillness,
or family/genetic variables. Equally importantly,
some patients with bipolar II depression may recover
just as quickly with psychotherapy as with medications
(Swartz, Frank, & Cheng, 2012).

Family members are sometimes a major source of
resistance. Their reasons can include a desire to distance
themselves from the patient (whom they may
have tried to help for years without reward), time or
distance constraints, or the discomfort of talking about
family or couple issues in front of a stranger. More subtle
is the fear of being blamed for the disorder (Hatfield,
Spaniol, & Zipple, 1987). The family therapy movement
has come a long way, but it still has its roots in a
culture that faulted parents for causing mental illness.
The theoretical model underlying FFT does not in any
way link poor parenting to the onset of bipolar disorder.
Nonetheless, a clinician often needs to make clear
early in treatment that he/she does not adhere to this
antiquated position.

future DirectioNs

Important future research will include effectiveness
studies, which examine the clinical impact of psychotherapy
as delivered to patients in “real-world”
(typically community mental health) settings, by the
clinicians who work in these settings and the time constraints
within which they work. As explained earlier,
FFT was found to be effective in stabilizing depression

and maintaining wellness in the large-scale STEP-BD
study of community effectiveness, which included therapists
working in 15 outpatient sites (Miklowitz et al.,
2007b). It remains to be seen whether FFT, along with
other treatments whose evidence base includes STEP-
BD (CBT, IPSRT), will be taken up by practicing clinicians.


A related problem is determining the proper structure
of FFT. In many community settings, insurance
companies only pay for six to eight sessions. FFT is
rather time-intensive, and research is needed to determine
which of its components predict the greatest
proportion of variance in the clinical outcome of
participants and the quality of life of family members.
For example, it is possible that some families will benefit
from just the psychoeducation module or just the
communication module. Perhaps these modules could
be streamlined without a great loss in treatment effect
size. Ideally, decisions to modify treatments such as
FFT will be based on clinical outcomes research rather
than solely on the desire for cost containment.

A final direction is the applicability of FFT and other
psychotherapy treatments to child and adolescent patients
with bipolar disorder, or genetically vulnerable
children who are showing early prodromal signs. The
fact that bipolar disorder even exists in school-age or
early adolescent youth is just now being recognized,
and factors that predict the onset of the full disorder—
such as the presence of a family history of mania—
are being identified (Axelson, Birmaher, Strober, et al.,
2011; Birmaher et al., 2009). Our current research is
examining whether giving FFT in the earliest stages of
the disorder reduces the risk of developing the full syndrome
(Miklowitz et al., 2013). Possibly the negative
symptomatic and psychosocial outcomes of adult bipolar
disorder can be mitigated through early detection
and carefully planned preventive interventions.

schizophrenia and other
Psychotic Disorders

Nicholas tarrier

Among the most remarkable advances in the last decade is the direct treatment of “positive”
symptoms of schizophrenia with psychological treatments. Many of these advances
originally emanated from the United kingdom, where a group of senior investigators
working in the context of the national Health service (nHs) developed and evaluated
these approaches. nick Tarrier was at the forefront of this group during this period. in
the context of case management and antipsychotic medication, this very creative mix of
treatment components has been proven effective for chronic patients who do not fully
respond to medication, as well as for patients in an acute stage of the disorder. evidence is
now sufficient that government‑sponsored treatment guidelines in both the United kingdom
and the United states have incorporated these approaches into comprehensive treatment
recommendations. More recently, clear evidence has emerged supporting the use
of these procedures for preventing the onset of the disorder for those at risk. The thrusts
and parries of these techniques are illustrated in the case of “Jim,” who had developed an
intricate web of delusions reminiscent of russell Crowe’s character in A Beautiful Mind,
concerning complex schemes by others, including friends and family, to take advantage
of him and steal his money and his girlfriend. The therapist’s skill in carrying out these
new approaches is never better illustrated than in this chapter. These new, empirically
supported psychological treatments represent the front line of our therapeutic work with
these severely disturbed patients and are capable of further alleviating to some degree the
tragedy that is schizophrenia.—D. H. B.

schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that is
characterized by positive symptoms of hallucinations,
delusions, and disorders of thought. Typically, hallucinations
are auditory, in the form of hearing voices
that often talk about the person and in the third person,
although hallucinations can occur in other senses.
Delusions are frequently bizarre, are held with strong
conviction, and often involve a misinterpretation of
perception or experience. The content of delusions

may include a variety of themes, including alien control;
persecution; reference; and somatic, religious, or
grandiose ideas. Disorders of thought are inferred from
disruption and disorganization in language. Hallucinations
and delusions, and sometimes thought disorders,
are referred to as “positive symptoms” and reflect an
excess or distortion of normal functioning. “Negative
symptoms” are also frequently present and reflect a decrease
in or loss of normal function, including restric

tions in the range and intensity of emotions, in the fluency
and productivity of thought and language, and in
the initiation of behavior. The consequences of these
symptoms can be dysfunction in personal, social, occupational,
and vocational functioning. Comorbid disorders,
especially depression and anxiety, are frequently
present and further impair functioning. Suicide risk is
high. Aspects of description, diagnosis, and classification
of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders have
stimulated much debate and controversy over the decades,
and details can be found in most psychiatry textbooks.
They do not concern us here except to say that
there can be considerable variation in clinical presentation
between patients and in the same patient over time.
Furthermore, cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis
(CBTp) in recent years has mainly focused on the
reduction of positive symptoms and associated distress,
and that is our major concern in most of this chapter.
The standard treatments for schizophrenia remain antipsychotic
medication and some type of case management,
and CBTp described in this chapter is assumed
to be in addition to this. Indeed, recent revisions to the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(NICE; 2009) guidelines in the United Kingdom, and
the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team
(Dixon et al., 2010) in the United States, have suggested
that CBTp be offered alongside medication for all those
with schizophrenia.

DeveloPMeNt of coGNitive‑Behavioral
theraPy for schizoPhreNia

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for schizophrenia,
although following a common theme and set of principles,
has developed in a number of centers, mostly
in the United Kingdom, and has been informed by a
number of theoretical and conceptual perspectives. A
dramatic expansion in the use of CBT in the 1980s and
1990s in the treatment of anxiety and affective disorders
influenced clinical psychologists in the field of
schizophrenia, who were trying to understand and treat
schizophrenia from a psychological perspective. This
was especially true in the United Kingdom, where clinical
psychologists treated a range of disorders in adult
mental health services and were able to transfer their
treatment methods across diagnostic groups. The structure
and function of a system of universal health care
in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service
(NHS), facilitated such skills transfer and multidisci


plinary work. Furthermore, funding of the professional
training of health professionals, especially clinical psychologists,
has aided awareness and dissemination of
CBT for patients in general and for psychotic patients
in particular. However, dissemination of treatments
into the health service and the universal availability
of CBTp has been slow and not without its problems
(Brooker & Brabban, 2006; Tarrier, Barrowclough,
Haddock, & McGovern, 1999).

research eviDeNce

Clinical, ethical, and economic considerations have encouraged
clinical practitioners to be guided by an evidence
base produced from evaluations of treatments.
The evidence develops from uncontrolled studies and
small-scale projects to controlled studies, then to large
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of efficacy and effectiveness.
In spite of criticisms of the appropriateness
of RCTs in mental health (Richardson, Baker, Burns,
Lilford, & Muijen, 2000; Slade & Priebe, 2001), they
remain the “gold standard” by which all treatments are
judged (Doll, 1998; Pocock, 1996; Salkovskis, 2002;
Tarrier & Wykes, 2004). Once a database of controlled
trials has been established, then meta-analysis can
provide a measure of the average level of therapeutic
effect for that treatment. For schizophrenia, a number
of published meta-analyses indicate that CBTp is effective
in treating positive psychotic symptoms in psychotic
patients (e.g., Gould, Mueser, Bolton, Mays, &
Goff, 2001; Pilling et al., 2002; Rector & Beck, 2001;
Tarrier & Wykes, 2004; Zimmermann, Favrod, Trieu,
& Pomini, 2005), although there have been conflicting
findings (e.g., Lynch, Laws, & McKenna, 2010). Of the
20 controlled trials of CBT for schizophrenia identified
by Tarrier and Wykes (2004), data were available
from 19 studies on the effects of CBT on positive
symptoms. These studies have a mean effect size of

0.37(SD = 0.39, median = 0.32), with a range between
–0.49 and 0.99. Using Cohen’s (1988) convention for
categorizing effect sizes, 14 (74%) studies achieved at
least a small effect size, six (32%) at least a moderate
effect size, and three (16%) achieved a large effect
size. Overall these studies indicate a modest effect size
in improving positive symptoms compared to standard
psychiatric care (treatment as usual, or TAU), which
is probably not surprising given the nature and severity
of the disorder. An updated meta-analysis and review
indicated that effect sizes were 0.476 for CBTp

CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

on positive symptoms from 30 trials, 0.474 for negative
symptoms from 14 trials, 0.477 for social functioning
from 11 studies, and 0.424 for depression from 11 studies
(Wykes, Everitt, Steele, & Tarrier, 2008). A more
recent meta-analysis has extended findings by examining
the effectiveness of CBTp at follow-up (3 to 15
months after treatment), compared to TAU and other
psychological treatments (psychoeducation and family
intervention). Sarin, Wallin, and Widerlöv (2011) included
22 studies and 2,469 participants. When CBTp
was compared to other psychological interventions at
follow-up the outcome was statistically significant and
in favor of CBTp having a small treatment effect on
positive, negative, and general symptoms. When CBTp
was compared to TAU at follow-up and to other psychological
treatments immediately after ending, there
was a trend in favor of CBTp but this was not statistically
significant. Thus, there appeared to be a delay in
the effects of CBTp.

Symptom Management
in Chronic Schizophrenia

In spite of maintenance medication, a considerable percentage
of patients with schizophrenia continue to have
persistent hallucinations and delusions that do not respond
further to medication. The majority of the CBTp
studies have been carried out with patients who have
chronic illnesses. These studies, for which data were
available for 16, have a mean effect size of 0.4 (SD =
0.32, median = 0.33), with a range from –0.32 to 0.99
(Tarrier & Wykes, 2004). Another strategy has been
to adopt a less generic approach and instead use CBTp
to target a more defined participant group or specific
symptoms. Fowler and colleagues (2009), for example,
recruited young people with early psychosis and poor
social functioning and unemployment, and offered a
cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to improve
social recovery. Compared to the TAU-alone group,
those with nonaffective psychosis and social recovery
problems who received CBT demonstrated significant
increases in the number of weekly hours of constructive
and structured activity. Moreover, this was achieved in
association with clinically meaningful and significant
reductions in symptoms and hopelessness. Similarly,
Grant, Huh, Perivoliotis, Stolar, and Beck (2012) evaluated
an 18-month recovery-focused cognitive therapy
package to improve functioning and negative symptoms
in people with schizophrenia who had neuro


cognitive impairments. Those who received treatment
showed significant improvements in global functioning
and in positive and negative symptoms (motivation). In
an earlier study, Trower and colleagues (2004) targeted
harmful compliance in those with command hallucinations
using cognitive therapy. Significant reductions
in favor of the cognitive therapy group, which were
found in perceived power and omniscience of voices,
associated compliance behavior, and distress and depression,
remained at 12-month follow-up. This study
is currently being replicated in a large multicenter RCT
with a longer follow-up to allow researchers to draw
more definite conclusions regarding the effectiveness
and durability of such an intervention (Birchwood et
al., 2011). Recently, there have also been more successful
approaches developed to treat delusional beliefs
by addressing worry, insomnia, and reasoning biases,
which are hypothesized to maintain the persistence of
delusions and related distress (see Freeman, 2011, for a
review of studies).

Symptom Recovery in Acute Schizophrenia

A handful of studies have investigated the use of CBTp
in the treatment of acutely ill patients hospitalized for
an acute psychotic episode. Because the participants
are acutely ill and may well be suspicious, agitated,
and unstable, the therapy is often implemented as a
“therapy envelope,” which comprises a range of durations
of therapy that can be delivered in a flexible manner.
Two studies have produced effect sizes of –0.49
and 0.93 (Drury, Birchwood, Cochrane, & Macmillan,
1996; Haddock, Tarrier, et al., 1999), indicating considerable
variance in this small number of studies. The
Study of Cognitive Reality Alignment Therapy in Early
Schizophrenia (SoCRATES) (Lewis et al., 2002),
which is by far the largest and methodologically most
rigorous study, recruited 309 patients with early-onset
schizophrenia and produced an effect size of 0.12. In an
18-month follow-up of this trial, both CBTp and supportive
counseling continued to confer clinical benefit
over TAU alone, although there was a trend toward significance
for auditory hallucinations to respond better
to CBTp (Tarrier, Lewis, et al., 2004). A more recent
RCT included participants in the acute phase of their
first episode of psychosis who either received CBTp or
befriending. CBTp significantly improved functioning
when compared to befriending at midtreatment and

Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

not improve symptoms (Jackson et al., 2008). CBTp
appeared to promote early recovery, similar to the
SoCRATES study (Lewis et al., 2002). However, any
differences between the CBTp and befriending groups
were lost at 1-year follow-up. In addition, the lack of a
TAU group meant any additional treatment participants
were receiving as a result of their acute phase could not
be considered (Jackson et al., 2008).

Relapse Prevention

A number of studies have investigated relapse prevention,
or the ability of CBTp to prevent or delay future
acute episodes. Relapse is an important outcome because
of the disruption, distress, and economic costs
that symptom exacerbation brings. Studies of CBTp
interventions in which relapse prevention was just one
of a series of components achieved little success, with
four studies showing a mean reduction in relapse of
only 1.4% compared to control treatments, whereas
studies in which CBTp focused on and was dedicated
to relapse prevention resulted in some success, with
two studies showing a mean relapse reduction of 21%
(Tarrier & Wykes, 2004). The latest meta-analysis by
Sarin and colleagues (2011), which included a handful
of studies examining relapse rates comparing CBTp
to TAU and to other psychological interventions, did
not show any strong evidence that CBTp had treatment
effects in the prevention of relapse. Providing cognitive
therapy in the acute phase was also found to be
unsuccessful in reducing the number of admissions and
the total number of days in hospital at 1-year follow-up
(Jackson et al., 2008). A large, multicenter, methodologically
robust RCT investigated the effectiveness of
CBTp and family intervention specifically designed for
relapse prevention and symptom reduction in patients
with psychosis who had recently relapsed (Garety et al.,
2008). Both interventions had no effects on remission
or relapse at 12- or 24-month follow-up, although CBTp
reduced depression and symptoms, and improved social
functioning, and family work improved the distress
associated with delusions. However, a later study by the
same research group used novel statistical methodology
to reexamine the data (Dunn et al., 2012). CBTp
was found to be effective at increasing months in remission
and reducing symptoms, but only when therapy
was completed in full and included a range of cognitive
and behavioral strategies targeting relapse prevention
and symptoms.

Early Intervention

In addition to the effect on individuals with more established
psychoses, there has been growing interest in
diverting the course in schizophrenia at an early stage.
Morrison and colleagues (2004) reported a study using
CBT techniques in this early group to attempt to avert
or postpone the first acute episode of the disorder by
intervening during a prodromal period. Their technique
focused not on frank positive symptoms, but on
problem-solving difficulties. The results of this first
RCT appeared promising. CBTp proved more beneficial
than TAU in preventing progression into psychosis,
preventing the prescription of antipsychotic medication,
and reducing symptoms. However, in a more recent,
much larger multisite RCT that compared cognitive
therapy offered to young people at risk for serious
mental illness and TAU, these findings were not replicated.
There were no differences between the groups in
terms of transition to psychosis over 12 to 24 months,
although the authors discuss the possibility that their
study lacked the power to detect a difference due to unexpectedly
low conversion rates in the control group,
and they questioned the at-risk mental state of their
sample, as well as the impact of their active monitoring
control condition (Morrison, French, et al., 2012).
Therapy did confer clinically meaningful benefits in
symptom frequency and intensity. This same research
group has also evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive
therapy for those within early interventions services
who discontinued antipsychotic medication (Morrison,
Hutton, et al., 2012). All participants received therapy,
which was associated with improvements in positive
and negative symptoms and functioning at the end of
treatment and follow-up, and increases in self-rated
recovery at follow-up. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs
of early intervention services, CBT, and family interventions
for those with early psychosis (3–5 years after
illness onset) confirmed the positive effects of intervening
in this crucial period. Early intervention services,
which included CBTp, family work, and medication as
part of the care package, allowed better access to and
engagement with treatment, as well as reduced relapse
rates, hospital admissions, and symptoms. CBTp alone
improved symptom severity at 2-year follow-up, while
family therapy improved relapse rates and hospital
admissions at the end of treatment (Bird et al., 2010).
Therefore, a holistic treatment plan provided by early
intervention services appears advantageous during the
initial stages of illness.

Summary of Evidence

The evidence for CBTp reducing positive symptoms in
chronic, partially remitted patients with schizophrenia
is good. Evidence that CBTp speeds recovery in acutely
ill patients to the level of achieving a significant clinical
benefit is more equivocal. Reductions in relapse rates
are achieved when the intervention focuses on and is
dedicated to relapse reduction, but they are disappointing
for standard CBTp. There is positive evidence that
CBTp and family intervention can benefit patients in
early intervention services who are in the early stages
of illness. Offering CBT in the prodromal phase appears
to provide little additional benefit in terms of
preventing full psychosis in vulnerable individuals, although
symptoms can be improved.

theoretical aDvaNces

There has been considerable debate about the theoretical
understanding of schizophrenia, with biological
explanations being dominant. However, psychological
and social factors have consistently been shown
to be influential, certainly in affecting the course of
schizophrenia, and have been incorporated into stress–
vulnerability models that have emphasized the importance
of these psychosocial factors in precipitating and
maintaining psychotic episodes (Nuechterlein, 1987).
Cognitive models have been developed in tandem with
advances in CBT (Garety, Kuipers, Fowler, Freeman,
& Bebbington, 2001). It is expected that as these cognitive
models develop and are subjected to empirical
tests, further refinements of CBTp treatment will develop.
For example, CBTp appears to have little significant
effect in reducing suicide risk (Tarrier, Haddock, et al.,
2006); however, with a greater conceptual understanding
of the psychological mechanisms underlying such
risk, more focused interventions to reduce risk will
arise (Bolton, Gooding, Kapur, Barrowclough, & Tarrier,
2007; Johnson, Gooding, & Tarrier, 2008).

Basic cliNical PriNciPles

A number of common clinical strategies underlie all
variants of CBTp for schizophrenia: engagement and
establishment of a therapeutic relationship; assessment
based on an individualized case formulation that
identifies psychotic experience (symptoms) and establishes
associations between the patient’s cognition,

behavior, and affect within the environmental context
in response to this experience; and an intervention
strategy based on this formulation that uses cognitive
and behavioral methods to reduce psychotic symptoms
and associated emotional distress. Patients are taught
to be aware of their symptoms and to learn methods to
manage them (e.g., learning to control auditory hallucinations
by switching their attention away from them,
or by thinking about alternative explanations for their
experiences).

Patients can acquire coping strategies that are broken
down into elements, learned individually, then aggregated
into an overall strategy. To ensure that these
coping strategies can be implemented outside of therapy,
patients overlearn them during the therapy session.
Learning such control techniques allows patients to
challenge beliefs they may have had about voices, such
as “The voices are uncontrollable,” “The voices are
all powerful,” and “I must obey the voices.” Thus, by
learning to control basic psychological processes such
as attention, through attention switching and distraction,
patients also learn to challenge their beliefs about
their experiences and symptoms. Behavioral experiments
and reality tests may also be used to disprove delusional
and inappropriate beliefs. Particular attention
is paid to identifying avoidance and safety behaviors
that reinforce inappropriate beliefs. Changing these behaviors
is a powerful method of changing beliefs and
delusions. Patients may be assisted in their attempts
at behavior change by means of self-instruction and
coping strategies that decrease arousal (e.g., breathing
exercises; quick relaxation; guided imagery; and
encouraging positive task-oriented internal dialogue).
In some refractory cases, patients are convinced and
unshakable in the belief that their delusions are true,
and they are unwilling to examine the veracity of this
subjective experience. In these cases, the clinician must
negotiate treatment goals aimed at reducing distress
rather than the symptoms themselves. A failure to do
this will probably result in the patient disengaging and
refusing treatment.

It is frequently the case that the patient’s delusional
beliefs persist in spite of evidence to contradict them,
including evidence that occurs naturally and that is
manufactured by the therapist through behavioral experiments
and reality testing. To weaken these delusional
explanations, the therapist should use all available
opportunities, through guided discovery and
Socratic questioning, to reappraise the evidence for
the patient’s explanation of events, thus weakening the


Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

delusions. Pointing out the contradictory evidence in a
quizzical and puzzled manner, often known as the “Columbo
technique,” is advised, so the patient has to account
for contradictions and review his/her explanation
in light of this new and contradictory evidence. When
delusions are strongly held, this can be a slow process,
but the weakening of delusional beliefs can occur, or,
as happens in some cases, the delusional interpretations
remain or return, but their importance and distressing
nature are greatly reduced. For example, an older
adult female patient treated by one of the authors (N.
T.) experienced auditory hallucinations that were of a
blasphemous and obscene nature. She believed that her
brain acted as a transmitter and broadcast her thoughts,
so that other people in the vicinity could hear her blasphemous
and obscene thoughts. Her main social contact
was with her local church and associated social
club. One Sunday, during the church service, she heard
the voices and became convinced that her own thoughts
about the voices were broadcast aloud to the congregation.
She was mortified and so ashamed that she left the
church and was unable to return or to have any contact
with her friends. She was convinced that she had become
ostracized by the church congregation. On being
asked about the evidence for this, she replied that she
had since met other members of the church congregation
in town and they had totally ignored her, which had
further reinforced her sense of exclusion, shame, and
self-disgust. On further questioning, she revealed that
she had been walking on the pavement and had seen her
friends drive by some distance away. There was a high
probability that they had not seen her. Thus, her evidence
for being ostracized was challenged. We agreed
upon a treatment goal that would test her interpretation
of the situation. If the fear that the church congregation
would shun her if she returned was real, then she
should expect a negative reaction when she returned
to church. If the fear was irrational, there would be no
negative reaction; in fact, the others should be pleased
to see her return. She experienced considerable anxiety
at the thought of returning to church but managed the
return using methods she had learned to cope with both
the experience of auditory hallucinations and anxiety.
To her surprise, far from being shunned or ostracized,
she was greeted with warmth and concern. This experience
considerably weakened her beliefs that others
could hear her thoughts, and her delusions were rated
as minimal. On being asked about the events some
months later at follow-up, she said that she believed
others could hear her thoughts, but because it did not

appear to bother them, she was no longer concerned
about it either! In this case, her delusional explanation
of past events had returned but no longer caused her any
distress or disrupted her social functioning.

Emphasis has also been placed on improving the patient’s
self-esteem and feelings of self-worth. This more
recent addition to the treatment has been found to be
effective and well received by patients (Hall & Tarrier,
2003). In this chapter we have placed these methods
after the treatment of symptoms, indicating a progression
from symptom reduction to improved self-esteem.
However, there is no reason why improvements in selfesteem
cannot be initiated at the beginning of treatment,
and in some cases this may be desirable.

The future may hold exciting new opportunities to
use new technology such as smartphones to implement
real-time assessment and interventions, and to individualize
treatment protocols (Kelly et al., 2012).

Phases of the Disorder and Relationship
to Aims of Treatment

Schizophrenia, a complex disorder that may well be
lifelong, passes through a number of phases. For example,
the prodromal phase that occurs before a fullblown
psychotic episode is characterized by nonspecific
symptoms and symptoms of anxiety, depression,
irritability, insomnia, and quasi-psychotic experience
(e.g., magical thinking, feelings of paranoia). The prodromal
phase develops into a psychotic episode, during
which the most florid psychotic symptoms are present
and seriously interfere with functioning. A psychotic
episode usually requires acute management, frequently
including hospitalization. Recovery from an acute episode
of psychosis is followed by a period of remission
or partial remission with maintenance doses of antipsychotic
medication. It is not uncommon for residual
symptoms to remain during the recovery and remission
phase, and in some cases, there is little recovery at all.
Treatment aims and strategies for CBTp vary depending
on the phase of the disorder. For example, during
the prodromal phase, the aim is to prevent transition
into a full psychotic episode; during an acute episode,
the aim is to speed recovery; during partial remission,
the aim is to reduce residual symptoms and to prevent
further relapse; and in full remission, the aim is to keep
the patient well. The specifics of CBTp may vary de



CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

pending on these aims and the phase of the disorder in
which they are applied. For example, during an acute
admission for a psychotic episode, the patient is often
disturbed, distressed, and agitated. Thus, therapy sessions
are often brief and frequent, whereas for chronically
ill patients living within the community, therapy
sessions follow the normal outpatient format. In all
cases, therapy is tailored to the tolerance of the patient.
In all but the most exceptional cases, CBTp is used in
addition to appropriate antipsychotic medication. The
various phases of the disorder and appropriate treatment
strategies are outlined in Table 12.1.

Associated Features and Disability

It is important that the clinician attend to associated
features and complicating factors, as well as the symptoms
of the disorder. These vary from the effects of the
disorder on basic psychological processes (e.g., attention)
to clinical issues (e.g., suicide risk) to social issues
(e.g., social deprivation and poor employment opportunities).
These associated features are outlined in Table
12.2.

The crucial point is that the clinician be aware that
these problems can arise. Some of them can be dealt
with by keeping the message simple and brief, but with
plenty of repetition (i.e., use of overlearning in teaching
coping strategies). Writing down simple points for
the patient as a memory aid can also be helpful, as can
creating a small “workbook,” so that the patient has a
continuous record of these points. This is usually more
effective than providing handouts, which are rarely

read and frequently are lost. It is important to balance
the nature and duration of sessions against the patient’s
level of tolerance. Initially, it might be best to keep sessions
brief or allow the patient to leave when he/she has
had enough. The one-to-one nature of therapy is highly
stressful, so initial sessions may serve merely to provide
habituation to the social stress of being with the
clinician. Teaching the patient simple strategies to deal
with tension and anxiety (e.g., brief relaxation) may be
helpful in habituating to the therapy situation and may
also provide a concrete task on which to focus attention.
Simple attention-focusing tasks, such as focusing
on some item in the room for a short period, may be
helpful in reducing the effect of irrelevant stimuli on
the patient’s conscious awareness. It is also important to
recognize that the verbal and nonverbal cues the therapist
might expect to indicate severe distress, depression,
or suicidality may not be expressed by someone
with schizophrenia. Affect may be flat or inappropriate,
which may result in the therapist missing important
signs of risk. This can be avoided, in part, by knowing
the person and how he/she reacts, by never making assumptions
about mental state, and by having the patient
agree from the outset that he/she will inform the therapist
of important changes in his/her life or mood.

Unfortunately, some issues, such as social conditions,
are often beyond the therapist’s power to change
but may well have an impact on the treatment process.
However, there is nothing wrong in assuming an advocacy
role or in helping patients to empower themselves
by aiding their attempts to improve their own circumstances.
Finally, it is important that therapists adopt a

the coNtext of theraPy

It is highly probable that by the time a referral is made
for CBT the patient will be under the care of a multidisciplinary
mental health team, and be receiving antipsychotic
medication and some type of case management.
People who develop a psychotic illness are usually diag


nosed by a general practitioner or primary care team, or
in an accident and emergency department, and referred
on to mental health services. Mental health services
are organized in different ways in different countries,
depending on health care philosophies and structures,
but what is delivered in terms of therapy content may
be independent of how that service is organized. Thus,
the therapeutic procedures described in this chapter
can be utilized in different types of service structure
and organization. We have provided CBTp to patients
on closed and open wards, in hospital and health center
outpatient facilities, in community facilities, and in the
patients’ own homes. It is probable that the more flexible
the system, the more likely the patient will be engaged
and attend. To this end we often deliver treatment in the
patient’s home, which is a common procedure in the
United Kingdom.


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

Evidence from research trials indicates that
cognitive-behavioral treatments are delivered over
about 20 treatment sessions. These can be intensive,
over 3 months, or less intensive, over 9 months or longer.
Clinical impressions indicate that some patients
benefit from continued, although less intensive treatment,
whereas others benefit from booster sessions.
The clinician should always be led by the clinical need
of the patient and take a collaborative approach rather
than adhering to a rigid “one size fits all” protocol.
It should be remembered that CBT does not “cure”
schizophrenia, but it does help the patient cope with a
chronic illness.

The presence of possible associated factors, as outlined
earlier, signifies that patients may present with
a number of clinical difficulties, as well as psychotic
symptoms. The clinician needs to be aware that this
may be the case and be prepared to address or treat
these presenting problems before moving on to treat
the psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to tackle
clinical problems such as high levels of anxiety, depression,
hopelessness, and suicidal behavior and risk because
they are not only clinical priorities but also there
may be important interactions between these other disorders
and the psychosis.

The treatment described here is for individual CBTp.
It is possible to deliver treatment in a group format.
Groups are well received by some patients and are
advantageous, in that patients can learn from each
other. The results suggest clinical benefits in terms
of enhanced self-esteem, but reductions in symptoms
are modest compared to those in individual treatments
(e.g., Barrowclough et al., 2006), and any improvements
appear to get lost at follow-up (Lecomte, Leclerc,
& Wykes, 2012).

Other psychosocial treatments may also be available,
such as family interventions. There is a considerable literature
on family interventions, which have been shown
to reduce relapse rates in at-risk individuals, for those in
the early stages, and in later psychosis (Bird et al., 2010;
Onwumere, Bebbington, & Kuipers, 2011; Onwumere
& Kuipers, 2011). Details of family intervention are beyond
the scope of this chapter (for the clinical application
of family interventions, see Barrowclough & Tarrier,
1992; Kuipers, Onwumere, & Bebbington, 2010;
Mueser & Glynn, 1995; see also Miklowitz, Chapter
11, this volume). We have combined individual CBT
and family intervention with some success and suggest
that therapists consider whether this strategy would be
clinically beneficial. Others have offered family thera


py to those with co-occurring schizophrenia spectrum
diagnoses and substance misuse, with some benefits in
symptoms and functioning for both clients and their
relatives (Mueser et al., 2013). Concomitant family
intervention may reduce stressful home environments
and help to sustain improvement. Many patients live
alone or are estranged from their relatives, so family
intervention may not be an option.

Patient Variables

Patients with schizophrenia represent a heterogeneous
group of whom 20–45% may be resistant to medication
treatment (Kane, 1999) and 5–10% show no benefit from
antipsychotic medication (Pantelis & Barns, 1996). Although
there is confusion among the terms “treatmentresistant,”
“incomplete recovery,” and “treatment intolerance,”
it is clear that conventional treatment with
antipsychotic medication is ineffective in a significant
number of patients, in spite of well-publicized advances
in antipsychotic medication. It is important, therefore,
in tailoring and refining treatments to understand what
factors predict a good response to psychological treatment
and perhaps the converse, which patients do not
derive benefit. Unfortunately, little is known in any
great detail about which patients will or will not benefit
from cognitive-behavioral treatments (Tarrier &
Wykes, 2004). Factors that have been associated with
poor outcome include negative symptoms of affective
flattening and alogia (cognitive impoverishment) (Tarrier,
1996). Factors associated with better outcome
include a shorter duration of illness, a younger age
(Morrison, Turkington, et al., 2012), greater pretherapy
coping ability (Premkumar et al., 2011) and better clinical
and cognitive insight (Emmerson, Granholm, Link,
McQuaid, & Jeste, 2009; Perivoliotis et al., 2010), less
severe symptoms at pretreatment (Tarrier, Yusupoff,
Kinney, et al., 1998), higher baseline functioning and
educational achievement (Allott et al., 2011) and receptiveness
to hypothetical contradiction (Brabban, Tai, &
Turkington, 2009; Garety et al., 1997). These results
suggest that those patients who are younger with less
severe illness, fewer severe cognitive deficits, and better
functioning may respond better, but no hard-and-fast
rules are currently supported by evidence. Treatment
dropout is a further issue of importance. There is some
evidence that patients who drop out of treatment tend to
be male, unemployed and unskilled, and single, with a
low level of educational attainment and a low premorbid
IQ. They have a long duration of illness but at the


Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

time of discontinuation are not necessarily severely ill
and can function at a reasonable level. Fewer negative
symptoms, cannabis or other drug use, and factors such
as not having a family member involved with treatment
have been found to predict disengagement (Stowkowy,
Addington, Liu, Hollowell, & Addington, 2012). Dropouts
suffer from both hallucinations and delusions, are
paranoid, although not necessarily suspicious of the
treating clinician, and depressed and moderately hopeless.
The majority cannot see the point of psychological
treatment or think that they will not personally benefit
from treatment (Tarrier, Yusupoff, McCarthy, Kinney,
& Wittkowski, 1998).

Therapist Variables

Therapist variables encompass a number of factors, including
training, experience, competency, supervision,
and personal style. There is a tendency for health care
planners to expect, mainly on economic grounds, that
these complex therapies will be delivered by minimally
qualified clinicians. This may well be a mistake (Tarrier
et al., 1999). Psychological treatment of someone
with psychosis is complex, and besides having the skills
and experience to treat the psychotic disorder itself, as
outlined in this chapter, the clinician may well need to
be able to treat a range of comorbid disorders, including
anxiety, posttraumatic stress, depression, and addictive
disorders. It seems reasonable that to treat successfully
someone with a severe mental illness and very possibly
a range of comorbid disorders, the clinician should
be experienced and sufficiently well trained in CBT to
be able to react to various clinical demands and levels
of complexity. A recent study showed better outcomes
from CBTp to be associated with therapists who spend
the majority of their clinical time delivering this specific
intervention, and who receive frequent supervision
(Steel, Tarrier, Stahl, & Wykes, 2012). In our opinion
the treatment of psychotic disorders does not lend itself
well to merely following a highly prescriptive manual.
As indicated in the previous section on associated features
and disabilities, the clinician needs to be competent
in recognizing and prioritizing a range of presenting
clinical problems for treatment. Similarly, the
clinician needs to have personal qualities that engage
the patient, who may well be difficult to manage or disturbed,
and to tailor the treatment to that individual.
Previous research suggests that the absence of a positive
relationship is associated with a poorer outcome
(Tattan & Tarrier, 2000), so the clinician needs the ex


perience and patience to develop that relationship and
maintain engagement. A recent study used the Delphi
method to examine what experts in the field viewed
as important ingredients in CBTp. Elements such as a
detailed assessment, use of a cognitive model and formulation,
implementation of change strategies, and the
attitudes that should be held by therapists (e.g., normalizing
rationale) were agreed to be essential (Morrison
& Barratt, 2010).

A Clinical Model: The Coping–Recovery Model

The model developed and described by Tarrier bears
many similarities to other models and has benefited
from contact and discussion with other clinical researchers
in the field. The basic tenet is the recovery
model, in which patients are coping with a potentially
persistent illness that may well change many aspects
of their lives, affect their hopes and aspirations, and be
associated with comorbid disorders such as depression
and anxiety disorders. The therapist aids the patient
in facilitating, as much as possible, the process of recovery.
The coping model strongly resembles and uses
many methods of other CBT approaches but emphasizes
coping with symptoms rather than curing them,
and intervenes to modify cognitive processes (e.g., attention),
as well as cognitive content and behavior.

The clinical model that guides treatment is presented
in Figure 12.1. It assumes that the experience
of psychotic symptoms, hallucinations, and delusions
is a dynamic interaction between internal and external
factors. Internal factors may be either biological or psychological
and can be inherited or acquired. For example,
genetic factors may influence both the biochemical
functioning of the brain and cognitive capacity. Alternatively,
biological and psychological dysfunction may
be acquired, for example, in deficits in cognitive flexibility
and in the development of maladaptive attitudes.
Such internal factors increase individuals’ vulnerability
to psychosis, and their risk is further increased
through exposure to environmental stress, such as certain
interpersonal or excessively demanding environments.
The interaction between internal and external
factors is important both in the origins of the disorder
and in maintaining symptoms. A dysfunction in the
processing of information, such as source monitoring


CLINICAL HANDBOOK OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS


FIGURE 12.1. A clinical model of the origins and maintenance of psychotic symptoms.

in hallucinations (i.e., a belief about where the voice is
coming from) and probabilistic reasoning in delusions,
in combination with dysfunctions in the arousal system
and its regulation, result in disturbances of perception
and thought that are characteristic of psychosis. The individual
is reactive to these experiences, and there is a
process of primary and secondary appraisal in which
the individual attempts to interpret these experiences
and give them meaning, then react to their consequenc


es. Often patients’ appraisal of experience results in
feelings of threat to their physical integrity or social
standing and concomitant emotional reactions, and
avoidant and safety behavior. The immediate reaction
to the psychotic experience is multidimensional, including
emotional, behavioral, and cognitive elements.
Secondary effects, such as depressed mood, anxiety in
social situations, and the effect of trauma may further
compound the situation.


Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

The important aspect of the model is that appraisal
(including beliefs about experience) and reaction to
the psychotic experience feedback through a number
of possible routes and increase the probability of the
maintenance or recurrence of the psychotic experience.
For example, the emotional reaction to hearing
threatening voices or experiencing strong feelings of
paranoia may well be anxiety or anger. Both these emotions
include elevated levels of autonomic arousal that
act either directly, through sustained increased levels
of arousal, or indirectly, through further disrupting
information processing, to increase the likelihood of
psychotic symptoms. Similarly, behavioral responses
to psychotic symptoms may increase exposure to environmental
stress or increase risk of trauma (e.g., becoming
involved in violence or indulging in dangerous
behavior) that maintains or aggravates psychotic symptoms.
For example, paranoid thoughts may result in interpersonal
conflict or, alternatively, social avoidance
and withdrawal. Both situations are likely to increase
the probability of symptoms occurring. Interpersonal
conflict is likely to be interpreted as evidence for persecution,
whereas withdrawal and isolation probably
result in confirmatory rumination and resentment,
with a lack of opportunity to disconfirm these paranoid
beliefs. The appraisal of the content of voices or delusional
thoughts as valid and true may result in behavior
consistent with these beliefs and a confirmatory bias
to collecting and evaluating evidence on which to base
future judgments of reality.

Psychotic experiences can lead to dysfunctional beliefs
that are then acted on in a way that leads to their
confirmation or a failure to disconfirm. This can be
termed the experience–belief–action–confirmation, or
EBAC, cycle. It is suggested that such cycles maintain
psychotic experience through reinforcement of maladaptive
beliefs and behavior. The generic model indicated
in Figure 12.1 provides an overarching picture
of how the patient’s problems arise and are maintained.
Embedded within this model are the microelements of
specific, time-linked events such as the EBAC cycle
(see Figure 12.2).

Assessment

The clinician needs to be able to assess and develop a
formulation of the determinants of the patient’s psychotic
symptoms. Clinicians may find the use of standardized
assessment instruments helpful (there are many of


figUre 12.2. The experience–belief–action–confirmation
(EBAC) cycle.

these, and they assess a range of functions; see Barnes
& Nelson, 1994, for a detailed description and review
of assessments). We recommend the Psychotic Symptom
Rating Scales (PSYRATS; Haddock, McCarron,
Tarrier, & Faragher, 1999) as an effective method of
assessing the multidimensional nature of positive psychotic
symptoms. The clinician needs to understand
the individual variation in psychotic symptoms. This
can be achieved by the use of a semistructured interview
(the Antecedent and Coping Interview [ACI]; for
more details, see Tarrier, 2002, 2006) that covers the
nature and variation of positive psychotic symptoms
experienced by the patient, including beliefs about psychotic
symptoms, emotional reactions that accompany
each symptom, antecedent stimuli and context in which
each symptom occurs, consequences resulting from the
symptoms and how the patient’s behavior and beliefs
are affected, and methods the patient uses to cope and
manage his/her experiences. This allows the clinician
to build up a comprehensive picture of how the patient
experiences the psychosis on a daily basis and how his/
her affect, behavior, and beliefs are changed. The clinician
should be careful to identify avoidance and safety
behaviors that occur because of psychotic symptoms,
and examples in which the patient fails to disconfirm
irrational or delusional beliefs. The clinician should use
the clinical models shown in Figures 12.1 and 12.2 as
a guide.

Intervention

Coping Strategies

When the clinician has constructed a comprehensive
picture of the patient’s psychotic experience, he/she
can discuss this with the patient and present the rationale
for CBTp. There may well be patients who are
completely convinced of the truth of their delusional
thoughts and will not accept any alternative view, in
which case coping with distress should be advanced as
a suitable goal.

The characteristics of CBTp and coping training are
that

••
They are based on an individualized assessment
or formulation.
••
They emphasize a normal and general process of
dealing with adversity.
••
They emphasize that this is part of the recovery
process.
••
They are carried out systematically through overlearning,
simulation, and role play.

••
They are additive in that different strategies can be
added together in a sequence that progresses to in
vivo implementation.

••
They are based on providing a new response set
that will be a method of coping with an ongoing
problem rather than being curative.

••
Cognitive coping skills are learned through a process
of external verbalization that is slowly diminished
until the required procedure is internalized
as thought under internal control.

••
They enhance executive function.

••
The learning of cognitive and behavioral coping
skills develops through a process of graded practice
or rehearsal.

••
They provide opportunities for reappraisal and reattributions.


These coping methods include the following changes
in cognitive processes, cognitive content, and behavior.

ATTenTion sWiTCHing

A process whereby patients actively change the focus
of their attention from one subject or experience to
another, “attention switching” involves inhibiting an
ongoing response and initiating an alternative. Patients
are trained within the session to switch attention on cue
through rehearsal to external stimuli (e.g., an aspect

of their environment, such as describing a picture or
being aware of background traffic noise) or to internal
stimuli, often to a set of positive images. For example,
one patient who was asked to choose a positive scene to
which to attend chose a restaurant in Blackpool, where
he had had an enjoyable meal. He was trained to be
able to elicit a visual image of the restaurant by describing
the scene, furniture, decorations, and such in great
detail. He was then asked to remember the experience
of the meal in all his senses: the visual memory of the
food; its smell and taste; the feel of holding the knife
and fork in his hands; the experience of eating; and so
on. He continually rehearsed the memory of the meal
in the restaurant until he was able to elicit it at will. He
then rehearsed switching his attention away from delusional
thoughts to images of the meal. He was taught to
use the onset of a delusion as a cue for attention switching
(see “Awareness Training” below).

ATTenTion nArroWing

In “attention narrowing,” a process whereby patients
restrict the range and content of their attention, many
patients talked about “blanking” their mind or focusing
their attention as a method of coping. Evidence suggests
that one problem faced by patients with schizophrenia
is an inability to filter information input adequately, to
distinguish signal from noise. Training patients to focus
their attention and improve attentional control may assist
them in overcoming this difficulty by narrowing
and regulating their attention.

MoDifieD self‑sTATeMenTs
AnD inTernAl DiAlogUe

That patients’ use of self-statements can be incorporated
successfully into intervention has been known
for some years. The use of self-statements and internal
dialogue may take on a number of functions in emotion
control, such as teaching patients to overcome negative
emotions associated with their voices and in cueing
goal-directed behavior, and in cueing and directing
reality testing. In each case the patient is taught statements
that direct the appropriate response, such as “I
don’t need to be afraid,” “I need to keep going and get
on the bus,” or “Why do I think that man is looking at
me when I’ve never seen him before?” Within the session,
the patient is first asked to repeat the set of statements
or questions out loud when given the appropriate
cue. The verbalized statements are then gradually re



Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

duced in loudness until they are internalized. The patient
then practices these in simulated situations within
the session. Learning such questioning statements is a
useful stage in generating and evaluating alternative
explanations for experience.

reATTriBUTion

Patients are asked to generate an alternative explanation
for an experience, then practice reattribution statements
when that experience occurs. Initially, when we started
coping training, we used reattributions that were illness
related, such as “It’s not a real voice, it’s my illness.”
We have since abandoned this as unhelpful. We now try
to use other, alternative explanations: “It may seem like
a real voice, but it’s just my own thoughts” and “It may
seem as though people are looking at me, but they have
to look somewhere.” If patients do make changes that
increase their control over their symptoms or circumstances,
or challenge the omnipotence or infallibility of
their voices, then these changes can be evidence for a
reattribution concerning the nature of their symptoms
or their ability to exert control—for example, “How can
the voice be all powerful if it talks rubbish?” or “I don’t
have to believe it if it isn’t true.”

AWAreness TrAining

Patients are taught to be aware of and monitor their
positive symptoms, especially their onset. Patients not
only become aware of their experiences but they also
try to accept these experiences but not react to them.
Patients are aware of their voices but do not react to
them or become captured by their content. One function
of awareness training is to make patients aware
of the form and characteristics of their thoughts and
perceptions rather than the content—for example, to
monitor the physical onset of a voice, then use attention
switching to reduce the emotional impact of the content.
The aim is twofold: to assist patients in becoming
mentally disengaged from their symptoms, especially
the content, and to use symptoms as a cue to alternative
action.

DeAroUsing TeCHniqUes

Because high levels of arousal have been implicated in
the psychopathology of schizophrenia and frequently
occur as both antecedents and responses to psychotic
experience, teaching patients to cope with these is im


portant. These coping strategies may be simple passive
behaviors to avoid agitation, such as sitting quietly
instead of pacing up and down, or they may be more
active methods of arousal control, such as breathing exercises
or quick relaxation. We have not favored lengthy
relaxation training, such as traditional progressive relaxation
exercises, because these are time-consuming
and off the point. What is functional here is a quick,
usable skill.

inCreAseD ACTiViTy leVels

Many patients with schizophrenia are vulnerable to
delusional thought or hallucinations during periods of
inactivity, a problem to which they appear particularly
prone. Many patients report that finding something to
do is helpful. Thus, simple activity scheduling can be
a powerful coping strategy, especially if implemented
at the onset of the symptom, thus creating a dual task
competing for attentional resources. Besides increasing
purposeful activity this also reduces exposure to conditions
under which symptoms are aggravated.

soCiAl engAgeMenT AnD DisengAgeMenT

Although many patients tolerate social interactions
poorly, surprisingly, many also find social engagement
a useful method of coping. Possibly this may occur because
social interaction serves as a dual task and source
of distraction, and because it may help patients rationalize
maladaptive thinking. It is beneficial to be able
to titrate the amount of social stimulation involved in
any interaction with the tolerance level of a particular
patient, and to teach the patient that levels of social
disengagement may be used to help develop tolerance
of social stimulation. Social withdrawal and avoidance
are common responses to experiencing overstimulation
as a result of social interaction. However, patients can
learn less drastic methods of disengagement, such as
leaving the room for a short period and then returning,
temporarily moving away from the social group, and
practicing functional disengagement by not conversing
for short periods or lowering their gaze. By using these
methods, patients can control and tolerate social stimulation.
Patients may also initiate social interaction more
confidently as a method to reduce the impact of their
symptoms, if they feel they have some control over the
intensity of those interactions. Simple training in specific
skills for interaction and role plays can facilitate
this.

Belief MoDifiCATion

Patients can learn to examine their beliefs and to challenge
them if they are inappropriate by examining the
evidence and generating alternative explanations. Many
patients do this to some extent already, but the level of
arousal experienced, or the level of isolation and avoidance,
can make these attempts unsuccessful. These
methods are very similar to those used in traditional
cognitive therapy except that the patient may need more
prompting, and the goal is to incorporate the skills of
belief modification into a self-regulatory process. Patients
can be encouraged to question their beliefs as they
occur: “What would be the purpose of someone spying
on me; how much effort and cost would it take; how
would this be resourced and organized; and for what
gain?” Similarly, patients can be encouraged to look for
inconsistencies and use these to challenge their beliefs.
For example, the patient who was involved in a fight
15 years earlier, and still avoids young men because he
fears that the same group is out to get revenge, may be
asked to reflect on the fact that because the members
of the gang are now in their middle to late 30s, he has
been vigilant for the wrong age group. This can be used
to challenge his fear that he needs to be vigilant to stay
safe. In effect, his safety behaviors have not protected
him from the source of danger. Patients can also learn
to examine evidence to challenge their beliefs about the
voices they hear. When patients perceive their voices as
omnipotent and truthful, clinicians can investigate to
see whether they have been wrong or incorrect. For example,
the patient whose voices told him he was going
to be murdered because he was a spy, concluded that
the voices must be true and that he must deserve this
fate. However, the voices also told him that he was soon
to be married, and because he could find no supporting
evidence for this, he decided it was untrue. However,
he had never thought to challenge the voices’ veracity
concerning the threat of murder. Realizing that he was
unlikely to be married in the near future, as the voices
had asserted, helped him to challenge the idea that he
was to be murdered by doubting the truthfulness of the
voices and to look for further supporting, objective evidence
of the spy ring, which was not forthcoming.

reAliTy TesTing AnD BeHAViorAl exPeriMenTs

Probably the strongest way to test beliefs is to test them
out in reality by some type of action; behavior change is
probably the best way to produce cognitive change. Pa


tients sometimes do this naturally, although a tendency
toward biased interpretation and hypothesis protection
may lead them to erroneous conclusions. Patients can
learn to identify specific beliefs and to generate competing
predictions that can be tested. The failure to do
this in real life usually leads to patterns of avoidance,
which can be reversed to challenge the beliefs that they
underpin.

Enhancing Coping Strategies

Coping methods develop over time and vary in their
complexity, from simple and direct attempts to control
cognitive processes, such as attention, to more complex,
self-directed methods that modify cognitive content
and inference. Frequently, combinations of different
coping strategies are built up, for example, the use
of attention switching and dearousing techniques helps
to dull the strength of a delusion, so that reality testing
can be implemented. Without these initial coping
methods the patient would not be able to undergo reality
testing. Furthermore, the initial coping strategies
can be used to challenge the strength of the delusion of
the omnipotence of the voices and provide an increase
in self-efficacy. The therapist may ask questions, such
as “You’ve used these attention-switching methods to
cope effectively with your voices. What does that tell
you about them being in total control and you being
helpless?” The patient may well make statements that
indicate the voices have been demonstrated to be fallible
and he/she has some control over the situation,
which can then be used as self-statements or a modified
internal dialogue to further enhance self-efficacy and
coping.

Modification of Behavior or Cognition

Changes in behavior and cognition complement each
other, and one is not necessarily better than the other.
Changes in behavior should always be used to examine
and potentially challenge maladaptive thoughts and
beliefs or as learning experiences. Similarly, changes
in cognition should be used as opportunities to change
behavior and to establish new behaviors. The therapist
should always look for opportunities to prompt patients
to reappraise their beliefs. This can be carried out as
part of formal behavioral experiments, naturally occurring
changes, and frequent reflections on what has been
achieved in treatment. In assessment and during formulation
the therapist should always be alert to patients’


Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

avoidance or safety behaviors, or when patients do not
behave in a way that could disconfirm their fears, delusions,
or maladaptive cognitions. These can be used
very early on in treatment as behavioral experiments to
test out patients’ beliefs or to provide opportunities for
quick improvements to challenge despondent or hopelessness
beliefs, such as “Nothing is worth it if I cannot
change” or “I have no control over my life or circumstances.”
The belief of “no control” is often present and
can be refuted by many small behavioral changes that
may be repeated and referred to frequently. Finally, it
is often helpful at the beginning of treatment to obtain
some behavior changes, although often small, and increase
activity that may have a number of associated
benefits and provide the opportunity for reappraisal.

Modification of Cognitive Content
or Cognitive Process

Therapists frequently face the choice of whether to try
to modify the content of hallucinations or delusions,
or the attentional processes that these phenomena
have captured. Traditionally, in cognitive therapy the
content of cognition is the main focus. In the coping
model intervention, this is broadened to modification
of cognitive processes because modifying cognitive
processes provides greater clinical flexibility, and because
deficits of the regulation of attention and executive
function are often present in psychotic disorders.
In practice, these tactics can work together. Initial
modification of attentional processes through attention
switching, for example, can decrease the emotional impact
of the experience. A similar effect can be produced
by attending to the physical characteristics of a hallucination
rather than what the voice is actually saying.
This can provide not only an opening to challenge the
truth of the content of the voice or delusional thought
but also a sense of control over these experiences. Take,
for example, a young man who is experiencing voices
that accuse him of having committed a murder and also
say he is Russian. Initially, he can be taught to turn his
attention away from the voices in a systematic way to
reduce their emotional impact. This technique can be
used to weaken the emotional strength of the experience,
to elicit a sense of control, and to challenge the
belief that the voices are all-powerful. With increased
self-efficacy and a greater sense of power, the patient
can later challenge the content of the voices that accuse
him of murder by investigating the objective evidence
that a murder has been committed. Furthermore, the

untruthfulness of the voices in saying he is Russian can
be used to challenge the veracity of the murder accusation;
if the voices had been wrong about one issue,
then they could be wrong about the other. Modification
of cognitive process and content provides the therapist
with two basic routes to intervention and the flexibility
to move from one tactic to the other.

case stuDy

The following case example gives some indication of
how CBTp works.

History

Jim, a 28-year-old man, developed a psychotic illness
when he was 22. During his first episode, Jim became
increasingly paranoid and accused people, including
his friends, of stealing his money. He said that he
could feel people taking money and his wallet from
his pockets when he was socializing in his local pub
and also when he was traveling by bus. The feeling
that “something was wrong” had been with him for a
few months, and Jim then began to hear voices warning
him that people were against him and scheming to
“do me down.” These voices talked to Jim, warning
him against “the schemes” and telling him who was
involved and to be on his guard. These voices were
especially insistent that those closest to Jim were the
people most against him and the “worst schemers.” The
voices also told Jim that his girlfriend was unfaithful,
and he experienced “visions,” sent by the voices, of his
girlfriend having sex with other men. He did not actually
believe that his girlfriend was unfaithful, but he
became very angry that the voices should make these
accusations. On some occasions, Jim did lose control
and confronted some male friends about having affairs
with his girlfriend. Usually he accepted their denials.

Jim also heard voices talking about him. These different
voices were usually “scheming” and making
insulting and accusatory comments. Sometimes these
voices would laugh at Jim because his girlfriend was
cheating on him, and make remarks about his sexual
inadequacy, to which they attributed her infidelity.

Jim’s friends and family noticed that he began to
withdraw and became increasingly disheveled. He was
often found muttering to himself or making sarcastic
comments to family members about how they were
“growing rich on my hard work.” The voices also told


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

him to “look for signs that the scheming is coming to a
head.” Jim began to write down an account of everyday
events, such as the time certain buses arrived near his
house and the type of advertisements on their sides. His
parents, who would find these writings left around the
house with various passages heavily underlined, were
increasingly worried about Jim and also concerned that
he was drinking considerable amounts of alcohol. Jim’s
friends began to avoid him and he was increasingly isolated.
He broke up with his girlfriend, who could no
longer deal with his accusations of infidelity.

The situation deteriorated very rapidly during the
summer months, and Jim was hospitalized one evening
and detained under the Mental Health Act. He had gone
out early to his local pub. A number of his friends were
there, but he kept away from them, drinking alone in
a corner. Suddenly Jim got out of his seat and began
shouting at his friends, accusing them of stealing his
money, undermining his confidence, and spreading
rumors about him. He took some loose change from
his pockets and threw it at his friends. They tried to
ignore him, but Jim became increasingly agitated and
aggressive, and finally physically attacked one of them.
A number of people became involved, and the situation
became more chaotic as a fight broke out. The police
were called and Jim was arrested. He had suffered
minor physical injuries, so he was taken to the accident
and emergency department of the local hospital
and from there was admitted to the psychiatric ward.
Jim spent about 5 weeks in the hospital, during which
time he was treated with antipsychotic medication.
His health care plan included counseling, and his family
received psychoeducation, in that they were given
information about his diagnosis of schizophrenia and
general advice on how to manage him at home. Jim’s
symptoms remitted during his hospital stay, and he was
discharged, with frequent outpatient appointments with
his psychiatrist and home treatment with the assertive
outreach team.

Over the intervening years Jim had five more relapses,
during which a similar pattern would follow.
He would become paranoid, hear voices and become
isolated, and have increasing difficulty in caring for
himself. Each relapse was followed by a short period
of hospitalization with increased medication. However,
residual symptoms became common following an episode,
and in spite of increased medication and changes
to atypical antipsychotics, Jim continued to experience
auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and delusions
of reference. He often avoided going out or con


tacting people because of his paranoia. He was able to
initiate and maintain a relationship, although the voices
continued to send him “visions” and to question his
girlfriend’s faithfulness.

Jim was referred for CBT to treat his persistent positive
psychotic symptoms as part of a multidisciplinary
approach to his care and to promote recovery.

Current Situation

Jim now lives in his own apartment. He has good relations
with his parents, who live quite close by and
whom he sees every few weeks. He is unemployed and
receives disability benefits. Jim attends a day center for
people with mental health problems 2 or 3 days a week.
He had attended a local college to study computers but
recently discontinued schooling because he found the
social contact too stressful. Jim has a steady girlfriend,
Sue, whom he sees regularly. He has lost contact with
the friends he had before he became ill, and although
he occasionally sees them, he avoids them and places
he thinks they might go. He receives antipsychotic
medication, attends monthly outpatient appointments
with a psychiatrist, and is visited at home once a week
by a community psychiatric nurse who provides counseling
and support, and monitors his mental state.

Mental State at Referral

Jim experienced auditory hallucinations in the form of
a variety of voices talking to and about him. He described
these as “helpful” voices and “evil” voices. The
“helpful” voices warned him of the “schemes” of others
and told him about dangerous situations and times
when he was under threat. They warned him to avoid
“dodgy people” who might attack or assault him. Jim
thought their warnings were very helpful and was convinced
that acting upon these warnings kept him from
harm. The “evil” voices generally spoke about him,
saying that he was “stupid, useless, and no good,” “not
up to it sexually,” and other personally defamatory
statements.

There were voices that told Jim that his girlfriend
Sue was unfaithful and cheating on him. He was unsure
whether these voices were “helpful” or “evil.” These
voices also sent Jim pictures of Sue being unfaithful
and simultaneously told him that he was stupid and useless
to put up with it. He described these pictures as
“visions” that he found extremely distressing. Although
Jim said he did not believe that Sue was unfaithful, the


Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

voices became increasingly more intense and compelling,
and he was unable to resist shouting back at them.
Sue was able to reassure Jim that his fears were groundless.


Engagement

Initially Jim was resistant to contact with the clinician
(in this case, Jim had been referred to a clinical psychologist
for CBT). At the time of referral he was quite
paranoid, and when he was visited at his home for the
first appointment, having failed to attend his clinic appointment,
Jim refused to open the door. (It is common
practice for mental health professionals in the United
Kingdom to do home visits.) A short conversation
through the letter box ensued, ending with the clinician’s
statement that he would return at a more convenient
time. Two further visits resulted in Jim refusing to
open the door. The strategy here was just to make contact
to reassure Jim that his views were perfectly valid
and that another visit would be made at a later date to
see how he felt about things then. In situations in which
the initial engagement is problematic, the best strategy
is to “roll with resistance” and try to defuse the situation
and reduce any agitation, maintain contact, and
return at another time.

On the next occasion Jim was more relaxed and allowed
the clinician into his flat. Given Jim’s paranoia,
it was important for the clinician just to establish a
positive interaction and relationship at this point, and
not to introduce the topic of symptoms or psychological
treatment until Jim was completely comfortable
with him. So, in Jim’s case, the first couple of sessions
were kept brief and covered his general well-being
and topics of interest for him. The clinician’s primary
focus was to keep Jim engaged and to develop the beginnings
of a therapeutic relationship. It is not always
the case that assessment and treatment cannot be embarked
upon more quickly, but maintaining engagement
is essential.

The fourth session was longer and the clinician introduced
the possibility of psychological treatment. This
necessitated a discussion of Jim’s symptoms, along the
following lines:

“I understand you have been hearing voices when no
one is there? What do you make of this? Have you
any idea what these voices are? Are the voices a difficulty
for you? Would you want to try and do something
about these voices?”

These questions not only raise the topic of the psychotic
experience and the suggestion of treatment but also attempt
to obtain an idea of the patient’s beliefs about the
voices and whether they are perceived as real or not.

Similarly, the clinician can ask questions about the
paranoid delusions:

“It is true that you are having difficulties with people?”


“Are you feeling that some people are against you?
What do you make of these thoughts and feelings?
Why do you think it is happening?”

“Are they a difficulty for you?” “Would you want to
try and do something about these thoughts and
worries?”

Again, the clinician attempts to assess quickly how
strongly Jim holds these delusions and whether he
would consider treatment.

Jim was not enthusiastic about treatment. He thought
that his fears, as well as the voices, were real, and that
psychological treatment was not appropriate in his
case. This reaction is often encountered in patients with
residual and persistent psychotic symptoms. A number
of important points should be considered:

••
What needs to be done to maintain engagement?
••
How can a clinically relevant problem be identified
and mutually agreed upon?
••
How can treatment be framed so that the patient
sees it as achieving a positive and desired benefit?

First, it is important to validate the experience, but
it is not necessary to agree on the cause. For example,
in this case, it was important to agree that Jim did hear
voices and believe that some people were against him.
This can be done without agreeing that the voices come
from a real entity or that people are actually against
him. This helps to separate Jim’s belief about what is
happening to him from the experience; that is, that Jim
has the belief is not the same as that belief being true.
Similarly, that Jim hears voices is not the same as believing
these voices exist as an independent and real entity.
It may not necessarily be possible to agree on these
points at this time, but the clinician can return to these
issues. At the moment, engagement is more important.

Next, it is often helpful to investigate the consequences
of the experience. Some of the voices cause
distress, and Jim’s paranoid ideas cause him to be fear



CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

ful. Thus, distress and fear are more likely to be problems
that Jim will be willing to address. This can be
introduced as follows:

“You have told me that the voices sometimes make
you feel very upset. Perhaps that upset is something
I can help you with and that you would like to work
on?”

“The thoughts that some people out there are against
you and want to harm you make you very frightened.
Perhaps that fear is something we can work on together,
so you feel less afraid? Maybe if you were
less afraid you could cope better with dealing with
people. Would that be helpful to you?”

So in cases when patients are very deluded or lack
insight into their symptoms, trying to persuade them
to eliminate their symptoms and the experiences they
believe to be real can be counterproductive and jeopardize
engagement. However, trying to reduce distress
may be a viable alternative for a collaborative goal.
There is also an assumption from the model that reducing
emotional reactions to symptoms may well weaken
the symptoms themselves.

However, Jim remained unenthusiastic about this
treatment goal as well. His view was that being fearful
about people was a reasonable reaction given that there
were people who would harm him, and this emotion
kept him on his “edge,” so that he was more vigilant
for threat and danger. His belief was that such vigilance
actually kept him safe from harm, so there was
little motivation to change and put himself in harm’s
way.

To protect engagement, it is important not to dispute
or argue with the patient, and most definitely not at this
early stage, when the patient is not convinced that there
is any benefit to be gained from treatment. The next
strategy the clinician used to engage Jim was to ask
about his goals in life.

clinician: Jim, what sort of goals do you have? Is
there anything you would like to achieve personally?
Is there anything you would like to do that you
haven’t been able to do, for whatever reason?

Jim: Yes, lots of things. I’d like to get a job that’s well
paid. I’d like to go back to college. That would help
me get a good job.

clinician: Going to college would help you get a good

job. That is a very good idea. Would you like to go

back to college?

Jim: I would, but when I went before I had problems.

clinician: What sort of problems were they?

Jim: Well, I got scared of the people there. I thought
some of them were scary, dodgy, money grubbers.
The voices told me not to go. I have to do what the
voices tell me.

clinician: So one of your important goals is to get to
college so as to help you get a good job, but being
scared of the people there and the voices is stopping
you from going to college and achieving your goals.
Is that about it?

Jim: Yes, I suppose you are right.

In this way Jim has realized that his important goals
are being impeded by his psychosis, and he and the
clinician are able to agree on a problem that needs to
be addressed. Thus, Jim can see a benefit to receiving
treatment.

As well as maintaining engagement, the clinician
has learned quite a lot about Jim and his problems.
The voices warn Jim about certain situations, and he
listens to them and takes avoidant action; thus, he has
developed a number of safety behaviors that protect
him from perceived harm. Opportunities to test out or
refute these threat cognitions by dropping safety behavior
are not taken up. However, there are situations
that lend themselves to reality testing. Jim experiences
command hallucinations (voices that give him a direct
order) to which he responds. The likelihood that Jim
thinks the voices are powerful, and that he has little
or no control over them, provides future opportunity to
refute these attributions. Jim experiences some feelings
of dissonance in that he is now aware that his valued
goals are impeded.

Case Formulation

Treatment naturally follows from an accurate assessment
of the patient’s problems, and it is important to establish
details of the antecedents and consequences of
psychotic symptoms (see Tarrier & Calam, 2002, for a
discussion of case formulation in general). In this case,
Jim has many psychotic symptoms, and it is probably
best to deal with them in stages.


Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

Paranoid Delusions

Jim has paranoid delusions that occur in a number of
situations. When alone in his flat, Jim worries that his
old friends and family have stolen all his money and are
scheming against him. This is reinforced by the voices
telling Jim he needs to be on his guard. Jim also becomes
very paranoid when he goes out. For example,
in the street he scans the crowds for signs of his old
friends, so that he can make good his escape if he sees
them or “scary people” who might assault him. He is
also paranoid at the day center, just as he was at college.
The voices tell him the situation is dangerous, that
there are dangerous people about, and that he must take
care. Jim knows the voices will warn him of danger, so
he listens out for them and is attentive to them when
they occur. At the day center Jim becomes more agitated
the longer he is there, and he usually goes home
after a short time. In doing so he feels reassured that the
voices have helped him and kept him from harm. Jim
also wonders why the voices help him and concludes
that it must be because he is special in some way. This
puzzles him because the “evil” voices are unpleasant
and nasty to him. Jim concludes that because he is
special, he is being tested by the “evil” voices to see
whether he is worthy of their help. Only special people
would be helped and be tested. In thinking this way,
Jim has resolved the dissonance posed by experiencing
both “helpful” and “evil” voices.

The clinician and Jim decide jointly to focus on the
difficult situation at the day center:

clinician: OK, Jim, I’d like you to talk me through
what happens at the day center. The reason I ask this
is because you remember that attending college was
an important goal you wanted to achieve but couldn’t
because you felt suspicious of people there. Well, the
situation at the day center is a lot like that at college,
so we might learn how you can cope with returning
to college if we examine the day center situation.
Does that sound OK to you?

Jim: OK. Well one of the things that happens is that I
know the voices know I’m vulnerable because they
can tell when I’m like that, which is when they attack
me, but they also want to help me, so they warn me
about the scary people there.

clinician: How do the voices know you are vulnerable?


Jim: They can tell because they know how I feel.

clinician: How do you feel when you are vulnerable?

Jim: All shaky and on edge.

clinician: Is that like a feeling of being anxious or
stressed?
Jim: Yes, a bit like that.

It appears that Jim becomes anxious in anticipation
of going to the day center. There may be a range of reasons
for this, such as anticipatory and situational anxiety,
social anxiety, fear of being attacked, or general
elevated levels of arousal. One hypothesis is that Jim
picks up on this feeling of anxiety and misattributes
it to being “vulnerable” to the voices. This is because
his increased anxiety is associated with an increased
probability of experiencing auditory hallucinations, but
Jim attributes meaning to this association. Voices are
imbued with attributes of power and intent.

clinician: OK, Jim, so you’re feeling anxious and vulnerable.
What happens next?

Jim: Well usually the voices will start. They can say a
lot of things, but they will warn me about danger. I
know that the voices will attack me, but I want to
keep safe, and they will warn me so I listen out for
them.

Here, Jim is indicating that not only do the voices occur
in this situation but also his attention is focused on listening
out for them, which may indicate that the threshold
for detecting them is being lowered. This suggests
that a redirection of attention may be a helpful method
of coping with this situation. The clinician does not
suggest this method at this stage but he may call upon
it later.

clinician: When they warn you, how does it happen?

Jim: The voices will see someone that is dangerous and
they will say, “See him? He’s going to get you, he’ll
attack you. You better get out of here.” When they
say that, I can see this guy looks vicious and he’s
going to have a go at me, so I get out of there as fast
as I can.

clinician: Then what happens?

Jim: I get out of there, and I feel real relieved that I’ve
escaped. I feel real lucky that I’ve got the voices to


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

keep me safe. Otherwise, I’d be in for it, I’d be in
terrible trouble. The more I think about it, the more
lucky and special I feel. They keep me safe.

It appears that Jim attributes both personal meaning
to his voices and power to keep him safe. In fact he
has developed a type of safety behavior that reduces
his anxiety and helps him escape a feared consequence.
His avoidant behavior also reinforces his feeling of
being special.

This establishes a useful behavior cycle that the clinician
may utilize to help Jim abandon his safety behaviors
and to disprove his catastrophic predictions that
he will be attacked. First, it is helpful to establish a little
more detail.

clinician: You said that the voices warn you about
danger at the day center most of the time. Does this
always happen?

Jim: No, not every time. I always listen out very carefully
for the voices, but sometimes they aren’t there.
clinician: So when the voices aren’t there, what happens?
Jim: Sometimes I still feel vulnerable, but I just get on
with it.

clinician: Do you mean you don’t leave, you stay
there?
Jim: Yes, sometimes I get bored and go home, but usually
I stay and have a chat and a cup of tea.

clinician: Tell me, Jim, is it pretty much the same
people there whether you hear the voices or not?
Jim: Yes that’s it, pretty much the same people all the
time.

clinician: So sometimes the voices tell you someone
is dangerous, and you get out pretty quick and feel
relieved you weren’t attacked, and at other times
the voices aren’t there, but you stay with the same
people, those that you thought were dangerous before,
and nothing happens. Doesn’t that mean that at
times they are dangerous and other times they’re not
dangerous? Isn’t that strange?

Jim: Yes, I suppose it is. I’d not thought about that before.


Here, the clinician is looking for inconsistencies in situations
that can be used to refute Jim’s beliefs. The clinician
highlights the inconsistency in the logical pres


ence of threat and feeds it back to Jim, asking him what
he makes of it. The clinician pursues the point about the
inconsistency of the occurrence of the voices.

clinician: Sometimes the voices aren’t there. Why is
that?

Jim: I don’t know that either. Maybe they have to look
after someone else on that day. Yes, that must be it.
There must be other special people that they have
to look after and they are helping them. Just goes
to show how important the voices are if they have
lots of special people to look after. Means I’m really
special, too, one of the real special people.

At this point Jim appears to be confabulating and absorbing
this new information into his delusional thought
network. New information is processed in a way that
protects rather than challenges the delusional system.
This is useful because an alternative explanation—that
the voices occur when Jim attends to them and feels
stressed and are less likely to occur if he is more relaxed
and engaged—can be advanced and tested as an
alternative belief.

The clinician now needs to motivate Jim to test out
some of his beliefs. He compares the day center situation
with college and the achievement of an important
goal to motivate Jim to attempt to cope better at the day
center. Furthermore, it is established that generally Jim
enjoys going, although ambivalence is maintained by
his fear of attack. Being taught how to manage his fear
and be more relaxed in the situation is also a motivating
factor.

Jim needs to have a plausible set of alternative explanations
of what is going on, so that he may process any
new information differently and not reinforce his delusions.
In the past Jim has been told that he is paranoid
because he has a mental illness involving an imbalance
of biochemicals in his brain. This is not a particularly
attractive explanation to Jim. It does not reflect his actual
experience, and it is stigmatizing. Jim needs to be
presented with an alternative model of his experiences
that allows him to collaborate in his psychological
treatment.

The clinician might suggest that paranoia is a result
of misunderstanding or misinterpreting situations, and
that if Jim feels stressed and anxious, as he does at the
day center, then he may misattribute this physical state
to a “vulnerability.” He is more likely to experience the
voices when he is anxious, but this does not mean that


Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

the voices know he is vulnerable. The clinician might
also suggest that Jim ignore the voices when they tell
him he is about to be attacked and just get on with what
he is doing at the day center. Because the same people
are there, and they do not attack him when the voices
are absent, it is unlikely that he will be attacked when
the voices are present. Thus, a behavior experiment
can be established to test out whether the voices keep
Jim safe. This may help challenge Jim’s belief that the
voices are both truthful and helpful, and that they are
powerful and all knowing.

When Jim did enter these situations, he was acutely
aware that his voices might occur, so that he developed
an internal focus to monitor for feeling “vulnerable”
and an external attention scan for hearing the
voices. The former meant that he was more likely to
amplify any internal sensations. The latter meant that
he was more likely to verbalize what the voices usually
said to him as a match and also, paradoxically, to
focus his attention internally. This process of internal
focus and attention scanning was more likely to trigger
the voices. Intervention here involved persuading
Jim to use other attentional strategies when he entered
these situations. These strategies were rehearsed in
the sessions and prompted with appropriate internal
dialogue.

Jim also made a number of attributions about the
voices. He believed that the voices warned him of
threat because he “might be special”; he thought they
might be able to do this through telepathy, and that he
had little control over this process. Jim was troubled
because the voices were often unpleasant, and he could
not understand why they would be so if they were helping
him to avoid danger. But Jim concluded that because
he was special he needed to “be tested” by the
voices, which in turn confirmed his belief that he was
special. Of course, much of this explanation had been
built up on the incorrect premise that the voices were
actually warning him of a real danger, which could be
challenged. An alternative explanation of his experience
could be based on a normalization of this experience.
Everyone has self-referent or bizarre thoughts at
times, and in Jim’s case these are perceived as external
voices rather than being identified as part of the self
and merely thoughts. Jim found this explanation plausible,
although he was not entirely accepting of it. This
is not unusual; however, it did seed doubt in his mind
and could be referred to constantly, further weakening
his delusional explanations.

Two difficulties arose with Jim. He did not have an
alternative explanation for the voices other than they
represented some, albeit vague and poorly defined,
powerful entities or beings (delusional), or that they
were the manifestation of a biochemical imbalance in
his brain (disease). The clinician suggested to Jim that
his voices might be his own thoughts or a leakage from
memory into consciousness that was not identified as
being part of his self. This was why the voices often
reflected Jim’s fears or concerns, or aspects of his past.

The voices warned Jim when he was in danger. He
believed that the voices helped and protected him in
these situations. For example, on one occasion when
Jim was walking down a road, the voices told him that
a man coming from the other direction was going to
attack him. Jim crossed the road to avoid the man and
believed that in doing so he had avoided being attacked.
He also noticed that the man looked “suspicious,”
which further confirmed his belief that the voices had
saved him from danger. Here is an example of an EBAC
cycle to which we referred earlier in the chapter.

••
Experience—Voices tell him of a suspicious per


son approaching.
••
Belief—He is in imminent danger.
••
Action—He crosses the road.
••
Confirmation—He has avoided being attacked.

This can be used as another therapeutic example:

clinician: You’ve told me that when the man approached
you in the street, he was looking at you and
the voices told you you were in danger. What happened
next?

Jim: Well, I knew he would go for me, so I crossed the
street and got away.

clinician: When you crossed the street, did the man
look at you or follow you, or say anything?
Jim: No, I don’t think so.

clinician: Isn’t that strange, if he was out to attack
you?
Jim: Yes, I suppose so. I’d not thought about that before,
I was so glad to get away.

clinician: Tell me, Jim, when you walk down the
street, where do you look?
Jim: Well, where I’m going, of course. That’s a daft
question!


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

clinician: Well, it may seem so, but think where was

the man going when you thought he was looking at

you to attack you.

Jim: Well, he was walking toward me, and he was looking
in that direction.

The clinician continues his questioning, so that Jim
keeps returning to the conclusion that the man happened
to be looking at him because Jim was in his line
of vision, nothing more. There was no evidence of an
intent to attack, and once Jim was out of his line of
vision, the man paid no further attention to him. Experiments
can be constructed to further emphasize this
point. Sometimes Jim may be drawing attention to himself
by his own actions, which make people look at him
(the self-fulfilling prophecy). Again, this can be drawn
out by a similar line of questioning and tested. A similar
approach can be taken with other examples of Jim’s
paranoid behavior, and his behavior with friends and
family. The clinician always comes back to these past
examples of successful belief and behavior change, and
asks Jim how he feels about them and whether he can
identify any common factors between these past successes
and current problems.

“Visions” Sent by the Voices

Jim was very upset with the “visions” he experienced of
his girlfriend having sex with other people. He thought
these visions were sent by the voices, also by a process
of telepathy. Jim did not believe his girlfriend was
unfaithful, but he became very upset and angry when
the voices told him this. He tried to push the images
out of his mind, but when this strategy failed, he became
further convinced that the images were sent via
telepathy. The more angry and upset Jim became, the
more difficult he found it to resist the belief and to view
the experience of the visions as collateral evidence. An
alternative explanation was that the visions were mental
images that had become very vivid and occurred in
response to his catastrophic thoughts about his girlfriend’s
infidelity and persisted because Jim attempted
to suppress them. The voices were his own thoughts,
which again posed questions about his girlfriend’s fidelity,
because his constant ruminations on the topic
had made Jim feel insecure about his relationship. This
alternative explanation, in conjunction with a review
of the objective evidence regarding the security of his

relationship, significantly weakened Jim’s delusional
beliefs about infidelity, telepathy, and the reality of
the voices. The clinician introduced thought suppression
exercises to demonstrate the rebound effect of
Jim pushing the images out of his mind. Exposure to
the “visions” was also useful in this case (although it
might not be in all cases), demonstrating that images
held in attention fade with time, along with the distress
they cause, which was further evidence of an internal
phenomenon and not external telepathy. Jim was also
taught to identify the onset of the voices and to switch
his attention to alternative stimuli as a way to reduce
their impact and to demonstrate that these experiences
were more likely generated internally rather than coming
from an external entity. The clinician compared
these experiences with anxiety disorders in which catastrophic
beliefs and images serve to fuel irrational and
threatening beliefs, pointing out that vivid imagery of
“what might happen” or an imagined “catastrophe”
would produce a sudden cascade of intense emotions.
These experiences could then be relabeled as unpleasant
but highly improbable situations rather than reality.

Any slight reduction in the strength of a delusional
belief was also used to challenge Jim’s general beliefs
about control, threat, and veracity.

low self‑esteeM: a coMMoN ProBleM

Patients with schizophrenia frequently have a poor perception
of themselves and low self-esteem. These global
concepts can be hypothesized to be manifest in terms
of a negative self-schema. This is postulated as being a
consequence of severe mental illness and all that goes
with this. This can involve suffering the stigma of a
mental illness and even harassment and exclusion, the
effects of social rejection and negative interpersonal
environments, and the projected sense of being valueless
and devalued. Patients with depression and suicidal
ideation may feel increased feelings of low self-worth
because of their depressed mood. Furthermore, an attribution
process can make them think that if they feel
they want to kill themselves, then they must be worthless
and deserve to die.

The factors that potentially impact upon and maintain
negative self-schemas are represented in Figure

12.3. As can be seen, the factors that influence and
maintain negative self-schema are strong, multiple, and
relentless. The consequence of having a severe mental

Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

illness is the formation of such negative self-schemas,
which then serve to bias the way information is assimilated,
so that these negative schemas are maintained
and strengthened rather than being challenged and
modified.

Feelings of low self-worth can both inhibit the effective
use of coping strategies and increase the risk of
depression and self-harm.

Improving the Patient’s Self‑Esteem

The aim of this set of techniques is to produce generalizations
of positive attributes, challenge negative
self-schemas, improve global self-esteem, and elicit
positive emotional reactions. This method can be carried
out in two stages. The first stage elicits positive
cognitions about the self, and the second elicits a positive
emotional response. Alternatively, the two stages
can be combined, so that the processes of cognitive and
emotional responding occur together. The procedure
for the two-stage process is described for convenience
as follows:

Stage 1: Cognitive Responding

••
Ask the patient to produce up to 10 positive qualities
about him/herself (the number can be varied dependent
on the patient’s capabilities; it is important that
the patient not fail in generating the required number).

••
Once the patient has produced a list of these qualities,
ask him/her to rate each on how much he/she really
believes it to be true on a 0- to 100-point scale (where
0 = Not at all and 100 = Completely).

••
Ask the patient to produce specific examples of
evidence of each quality; prompt specifically for actions
that have occurred recently and can be time
linked, such as “last week”; also use your knowledge of
the patient to elicit examples. Prompt and list as many
examples as possible.

••
Ask the patient to rehearse the list of examples
for each quality, which may be done through verbal
description and mental imagery of the event, then to
rerate his/her belief that he/she possesses this quality.
(Usually the belief rating changes to show an increase;


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

it should be emphasized to the patient that his/her belief
can change depending on the evidence on which he/she
focuses attention.)

••
The patient is given a homework exercise to monitor
his/her behavior over the next week and to record
specific evidence to support the contention that he/she
has these qualities. The aim is to produce generalization
and experiential learning of a number of positive
attributes.

••
At the next session, provide feedback on examples
and prompt further examples. Again, ask the patient to
rerate his/her belief that he or she actually has these
qualities, and further point out any changes in these
beliefs.

••
Ask the patient to reflect on the effect that eliciting
and focusing on specific behaviors and evidence
has on beliefs and qualities about him/herself and how
this could affect the general opinion of him/herself.
Reinforce all positive attributes and the process whereby
the patient comes to a more positive view of him/
herself.

••
Continue to repeat this procedure. Continually
emphasize that the patient’s beliefs about him/herself
vary depending on what is the focus of attention, and
that self-esteem can be greatly affected by belief and is
thus amenable to change.

The case of “Dave” illustrates implementation of
this procedure. Dave had very successfully learned to
cope with his symptoms, which had been markedly reduced,
and he had significantly improved his level of
functioning. Dave produced a number of attributes that
he thought he might have: “helpful,” which he gave a
belief rating of 60 out of 100; “friendly,” which he rated
50; and “a good father,” which he rated as 30. He was
then asked to suggest concrete and specific evidence to
support all of these. For “helpful,” he cited having lent
money to a friend some months before, opening a door
to someone the previous week, and helping his father in
the garden that week. He rerated this belief as 90.

For “friendly,” Dave cited that he had had many
friends of 10 to 20 years’ standing; his friends contacted
him regularly and enjoyed his company; he could
talk comfortably to people in pubs or on buses. He got
on well with the friends of his parents. Dave thought
he got on well with the therapist and enjoyed speaking
to him, and that he could talk to different types of

people from different backgrounds without difficulty or
reserve. He rerated this belief as 100.

For being a “good father,” Dave said that he enjoyed
taking his son and daughter out every week (he was
divorced from their mother, who had custody). He was
upset when he did not see them. He liked to buy them
presents. He was happy for them to decide on activities
rather than doing things purely for convenience,
and this in itself gave him pleasure. Dave rerated this
belief as 60. However, at this point he introduced some
negative evaluations. He felt that he could not be a good
father because he did not live with his children. He
did not get on with their mother. He said that it was
always easier for absent fathers who saw their children
for short periods of time and tended to spoil them. This
was not responsible parenting in his view. At this point
it was helpful for the clinician to go through the model
of how negative views such as this are maintained (see
Figure 12.3), to discuss these thoughts as being negative
schema–congruent, and to indicate that the statements
were “overgeneralizations,” a process by which
negatives are maximized and positives minimized.
Furthermore, although these thoughts and beliefs had
a depressing effect on his mood and maintained Dave’s
negative beliefs about himself, they did not accurately
reflect circumstances. To challenge Dave’s views of
himself as a bad father, various exercises where undertaken:
He was asked to define a “bad father” in explicit
terms, then objectively compare his behavior to this
definition. He was asked to compare his behavior with
that of others in similar circumstances. Last, he was
asked to give a realistic and objective appraisal of his
performance and circumstances. While carrying out
these exercises, the clinician emphasized the potential
for negatively biased self-appraisals, along with strategies
for coping with this in the future.

Stage 2: Affective Responding

Dave was also asked to explain why these qualities
were important and the potential benefits of possessing
them. The clinician used guided discovery and imagery
during this process to ensure that the qualities selected
were meaningful and important to Dave. He was then
asked to generate practical examples of each quality.
Particular emphasis was placed on describing specific
behaviors associated with the quality and the context
in which they were carried out. Attention was directed
to Dave’s emotional experiences when displaying that


Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

quality, thus generating the positive affect associated
with that experience. Dave was asked to imagine the
positive emotional reaction that another person would
experience in interaction with him as he displayed a
positive quality, and to vividly imagine the other person’s
experience and describe how he/she would feel
and attempt to mimic this experience. Dave was then
asked to describe how he himself felt when he had
evoked the positive emotion in the other person.

For example, in displaying generosity by helping out
a friend, Dave was asked to imagine through guided
imagery how that friend felt when assisted by Dave. He
was asked to intensify and sustain this positive emotion.
Then, through a similar process, Dave was asked
to imagine and describe how he himself felt when he
realized how positive his friend had felt in being helped
out. Again, Dave was asked to intensify and sustain this
emotion. A similar process should be carried out for all
positive characteristics and scenarios.

PreveNtioN of relaPse

Relapses rarely occur without any forewarning. They
are usually preceded by a period of prodromal symptoms
that can last for days, or more usually weeks, and
in some cases, months; the average prodrome is, however,
about 4 weeks (Birchwood, Macmillan, & Smith,
1994). Common prodromal signs and symptoms include
nonpsychotic symptoms (e.g., mild depression or
dysphoria, anxiety, insomnia, irritability, mood fluctuations
and interpersonal sensitivity) and low-level
psychotic symptoms (e.g., suspiciousness, magical
thinking, ideas of reference, feelings that “something
is strange or wrong” and that the individual does not
“fit in” with others around him/her). During the prodromal
phase, patients display behavior change, such
as becoming more withdrawn, avoiding social contact,
abandoning hobbies or interests, appearing more preoccupied,
and being unable to continue with work or
other routine or demanding activities. As the prodrome
progresses, these signs and symptoms intensify and patients
may exhibit strange and bizarre behavior, such as
being unable to care for themselves, becoming socially
or sexually inappropriate, making accusations against
others, muttering to themselves, and disconnecting the
television or telephone.

Patients may be asked to recall prodromal signs and
symptoms that preceded previous episodes and relaps


es, which can be based on the onset of the episode or
admission to the hospital, then identify when changes
were first noticed, what changes occurred, and how they
progressed and in what sequence. Each sign or symptom
may be written on a card, and the patient may be
asked to arrange them in temporal order of occurrence.
In this way the patient’s relapse signature, that is, the
individual set of signs and symptoms that characterized
the patient’s prodrome and its time course leading
to relapse, can be identified. Family members or
professional mental health staff, if available, can help
identify prodromal changes and their sequence. Clinicians
may find the use of standardized assessments of
prodromal symptoms helpful, such as the Early Signs
Scale (Birchwood et al., 1989). Such instruments can
also help the clinician cue or inquire about possible
prodromal symptoms not spontaneously recalled by
the patient. The patient needs to be able to discriminate
between an actual relapse prodrome and normal mood
fluctuations that do not signal a relapse. This is done
through a process of discrimination training, whereby
the patient monitors mood and experiences over a number
of weeks, with a goal of learning to distinguish a
real prodrome from the “false alarm” of a normal fluctuation
in affect.

The next stage is to formulate a “game plan” to deal
with a prodrome should one occur. Coping strategies
can be formulated and rehearsed, the help of others can
be elicited, and the assistance of psychiatric services
can be requested, which may include an increase or
change in medication. With an understanding of the
time course of patients’ prodromes, the clinician can
identify different actions for different phases of the
prodrome and the “window of opportunity” to intervene.
An important part of the treatment approach is to
plan for the future, especially for potentially stressful
events that may occur and how to be aware of emerging
symptoms and relapse. Patients can be monitored
by returning to the clinician postcards that indicate
they are well or that a prodrome may have started.
Technology such as cell phones and e-mail may provide
new, innovative platforms and methods for clinicians
to monitor patients and maintain contact, to
identify early signs of relapse, and to intervene at the
optimal time. Such technological advances may also
result in real-time assessment and intervention, and the
development of intelligent systems to identify critical
periods and deliver individualized interventions (Kelly
et al., 2012).

cliNical ProBleMs aND Difficulties

Thought Disorder

Thought disorder, typically characterized by disruption
to language, makes it difficult to comprehend the
meaning that the patient is imparting. However, with
experience and patience, it is often possible to follow
some internal logic in the patient’s speech. This can
be accomplished by asking the patient to explain the
meaning, or by reflecting back one’s own understanding,
which is then rephrased in more coherent language.
Progressing through these organized steps in a
calm manner can help prevent the patient from feeling
overloaded with the emotional content of the discussion,
which can occur, especially when the material
being discussed is emotionally salient.

Intractable Psychotic Symptoms

Regrettably, there are cases in which the therapist’s best
efforts and optimum medication produce little improvement
in the patient’s symptoms. A number of options
are available in such intractable cases. First, it is necessary
to ensure that appropriate support services are in
place, so that the patient’s quality of life is maximized.
Second, there should be regular reviews of treatment,
especially of medication and of environmental circumstances,
so that excessive stresses are avoided. Last, it
is always worth continuing with a few simple and direct
cognitive-behavioral strategies because, over a long period
of time, these may begin to have an effect.

Risk of Suicide and Self‑Harm

The risk of suicide in patients with schizophrenia
is significant. Risk factors include being young and
male, having a chronic illness with numerous exacerbations,
high levels of symptomatology and functional
impairment, feelings of hopelessness in association
with depression, fear of further mental deterioration,
and excessive dependence on treatment or loss of faith
in treatment. In one study, two paths to suicide risk,
both of which were mediated by hopelessness, were
also identified: (1) increased social isolation, to which
longer illness duration, more positive symptoms, older
age, and being unemployed contributed, and (2) greater
negative views of the self, higher frequency of criticism
from relatives, and more negative symptoms, to
which being male, unmarried, and unemployed signifi


cantly contributed (Tarrier, Barrowclough, Andrews,
& Gregg, 2004). A more recent cohort study and systematic
review have confirmed and extended previous
findings. Being young and male with a history of violent
offending were identified as predictors of suicide,
although this latter finding was restricted specifically
to those with lower IQ (Webb, Långström, Runeson,
Lichtenstein, & Fazel, 2011). A systematic review of 51
studies additionally identified important illness-related
predictors such as depressive symptoms, hallucinations
and delusions, and comorbid physical illness and substance
misuse (Hor & Taylor, 2010).

It is important for therapists to be aware that suicide
attempts are a very real possibility while treating someone
with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, patients with
schizophrenia often commit suicide impulsively and
use lethal methods, such as jumping from heights, immolation,
or firearms. The presence of suicidal ideation
needs to be assessed, and the patient needs to be asked
whether he/she has made any specific plans or taken
any actions, and whether the normal barriers to selfharm
and suicide have broken down. It is necessary to
be aware of factors that can elevate risk, including erosion
of self-esteem; increased sense of hopelessness and
despair, especially related to the patient’s perception of
the illness and recovery; disruptive family or social relationships;
and any changes in social circumstances or
loss of supportive relationships (e.g., changes in mental
health staff, staff holidays, or leave). Furthermore, the
occurrence of major life events, loss, or shameful experiences
can lead to despondency.

Some factors that can increase risk for suicide are
quite unique to the psychotic disorders, such as the experience
of command hallucinations telling patients to
self-harm. Other examples are more idiosyncratic. One
of the authors (N. T.) had a patient who experienced
strange physical sensations that he interpreted as the
Queen of England entering his body. As a loyal subject,
he thought he should vacate his body to give her sole
possession, and he attempted to kill himself by slashing
his wrists. This was not the result of a will to die,
but was more driven by some sense of social protocol
toward royalty. Fortunately, the attempt was unsuccessful.


Many clinicians hypothesize that psychotic symptoms
have a protective aspect in masking the harsh realities
of the burden of serious mental illness. Improvement
in insight and symptomatology can bring with it
an increased exposure to this burden, thus increasing
the probability of potential escape through suicide. The


Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

clinician needs to be aware of all these factors, to know
his/her patients well, and to monitor changes in their
circumstances or mood that may be problematic. It is
important to be aware of predictable changes and plan
for them, to establish good communication with other
mental health workers, and to address depressed mood
and hopelessness in an open manner. Assessing acute
suicide risk is further complicated by patients’ flat or
incongruous affect, so that the cues a clinician would
look for in a depressed patient may not be exhibited by
a patient with schizophrenia. When risk is high, emergency
psychiatric services should be called.

Dual Diagnosis: Comorbidity of Alcohol
and Substance Use

Comorbid substance use disorders are an escalating
problem in patients with schizophrenia. Dual-diagnosis
patients tend to do worse than patients with schizophrenia
alone on a range of outcomes. They tend to be more
persistently symptomatic; to have more frequent and
earlier relapse and readmission; to be more likely to
present to the emergency services; and to have higher
levels of aggression and violence, and greater risk of
suicide and self-harm.

Motivational interviewing has been used effectively
to enhance motivation to change substance use behavior
in schizophrenia patients (Barrowclough et al.,
2001; Haddock et al., 2003). Motivational interviewing
has been termed a “style” rather than a specific intervention,
and can be incorporated into a CBT approach
to increase the patient’s motivation to change substance
or alcohol use behavior and concurrently address the
psychosis. It is postulated that an important interaction
between alcohol or substance use and psychotic
symptoms requires this dual-treatment approach. Many
patients do not consider their alcohol or substance use
a problem and perceive the positive benefits, such as
self-medication, peer identification, or enjoyment, as
outweighing any negative consequences. The aim during
the initial sessions is to elicit change or motivational
statements from the patient. The therapist uses
the motivational interviewing skills of reflective listening,
acceptance, and selective reinforcement to elicit
such statements. Once the patient identifies substance
or alcohol use as a problem and expresses a desire to
change, therapy can then progress to practical ways to
achieve this goal. The largest RCT to date compared
a combined condition of TAU, motivational interviewing,
and CBT with TAU alone in those with psycho


sis and co-occurring substance use. Results showed
treatment to be beneficial in improving motivation to
change substance use, and significantly reduced the
amount of substance consumed per day, with this latter
finding being maintained at 24-month follow-up. However,
there were no effects on clinical outcomes such
as relapse rates, symptoms, and functioning (Barrowclough
et al., 2010).

coNclusioN

CBTp does have significant benefits for patients with
schizophrenia and psychosis. It should be carried out
as part of a comprehensive care plan. It is unlikely to
“cure” patients, but it may assist them in coping with
and recovering from their illness. Intervention is based
on a detailed assessment and formulation. It does require
considerable skill, experience, and knowledge of
CBT and psychosis, and it does not lend itself easily to
a simple protocol format. Further research on theoretical
aspects of understanding psychosis from a psychological
perspective is important to inform and further
develop CBT procedures. Research into dissemination
and how new psychological treatments penetrate into
mental health services and become accessible to patients
are required.

Alcohol Use Disorders

BarBara s. MccraDy

Clinicians working with individuals with alcohol use problems, as well as clinicians in
training, have found this chapter to be an extraordinarily useful resource in guiding
their treatment approaches. in this thoroughly updated and edited revision, the author
begins by describing how recent societal trends and legislative initiatives have altered
the nature of the clientele with drinking problems that comes for treatment. After briefly
reviewing the available empirical evidence on treatment approaches that range from Alcoholics
Anonymous to brief interventions to intensive inpatient treatment, the author
describes the myriad factors that every clinician must consider in choosing and carrying
out appropriate interventions for individuals with drinking problems. Using a variety of
illuminating case vignettes, Barbara McCrady illustrates important therapeutic strategies,
including methods for motivating these patients to begin treatment. in a manner that
emphasizes the humanity of the couple and makes the partners come to life, the extended
case study in this chapter illustrates the all‑too‑frequent tragic consequences of excessive
drinking. in the context of this case description, the author describes in great detail
what clinicians will not find in books that simply lay out various treatment procedures—
that is, the thrusts and parries of a superb and experienced clinician in overcoming the
roadblocks that inevitably emerge during treatment.—D. H. B.

Alcohol use disorders are a heterogeneous group of
problems ranging in severity from the heavy-drinking
college student who occasionally misses classes to the
person with severe and chronic alcoholism who experiences
serious medical and social consequences of
drinking. Although the prevalence of alcohol use disorders
is higher in males than in females and in younger
than in older adults, these problems affect individuals
from any sociodemographic, racial/ethnic, or occupational
background. In mental health and medical
settings, at least 25% of clients are likely to have an
alcohol use disorder as part of their presenting problems
(e.g., Zimmerman, Lubman, & Cox, 2012), so
clinicians in health and mental health professions need
to be competent to identify, assess, and plan an effec


tive course of treatment for these clients. This chapter
describes the social context of drinking and drinking
problems, provides an integrative model for conceptualizing
and treating alcohol use problems, and presents
both a series of case vignettes and an extended case
study to illustrate the clinical model.

The clinician functioning in the 21st century must
provide treatment within a complex and contradictory
treatment network; must have formal and systematic
training in the treatment of alcohol and other drug use
disorders; must have tools to work with involuntary and
voluntary clients, those who adhere passionately to a
traditional recovery perspective, and those who are offended
by it; and must work either to promote major
and enduring changes in alcohol use or to decrease the

533


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

harm that individuals and groups may experience from
their use. The need for clinicians who are competent
in treating alcohol and other substance use disorders
(AUDs and other SUDs) will increase because of two
Federal laws passed in recent years. The Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 in
the United States, mandates alcohol and drug screening
and brief intervention in primary care settings as a
covered benefit, and the Wellstone–Domenici Mental
Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 mandates
comparable health care coverage for treatment
for physical health, mental health, and addictions problems.
If these laws are implemented successfully, more
individuals with AUDs will be identified and referred
to treatment.

Although the need for clinicians who are competent
to treat AUDs is likely to increase, many clinicians
may shy away from this population given the notorious
reputation of persons with AUDs for being difficult
and frustrating to treat. This chapter assumes that the
clinician who has useful and effective tools for working
with persons with drinking problems, and who has a bit
of success with these tools, will find positive reasons to
see these clients. Persons with drinking problems are
treatable; they are both challenging and rewarding to
treat; and when they change successfully, the clinician
has the rare opportunity to participate in helping people
make major and satisfying changes in their lives.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of alcohol problems in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013), treats
AUDs as a single disorder, ranging along a spectrum of
severity. Previous editions of the DSM discriminated
between alcohol abuse and dependence; this distinction
no longer applies. To be diagnosed with an AUD,
an individual must meet at least two of 11 criteria, and
the AUD is classified as mild (two to three symptoms),
moderate (four to five symptoms) or severe (six to
eleven symptoms). The 11 diagnostic criteria combine
the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence,
eliminating “repeated alcohol-related legal
consequences,” and adding “craving.” Thus, the diagnostic
criteria include (1) failing to fulfill major social

role obligations, such as those related to work, home, or
school; (2) drinking repeatedly in a ways that that have
the potential to create physical harm (e.g., drinking and
driving); (3) continuing to drink despite the fact that
drinking is causing social or interpersonal problems;

(4) having the desire to or attempting to cut down or
stop without success; (5) drinking larger amounts or
alcohol or drinking over longer periods of time than
planned, (6) exhibiting signs of physical tolerance; (7)
showing signs of physical withdrawal; (8) neglect of
other activities; (9) spending considerable time obtaining
alcohol, drinking, and recovering from its effects;
(10) continuing to use despite knowing that alcohol is
causing recurrent physical or psychological problems;
and (11) experiencing persistent craving for alcohol.
Alcohol dependence also may be classified as being
in “partial remission” or in “full remission”; remission
may be “early” (at least 3 months) or “sustained” (1
year or more).
Alternative Definitions

In contrast to the formal psychiatric diagnosis of an
AUD, behavioral researchers and clinicians have suggested
that alcohol problems represent one part of a
continuum of alcohol use, ranging from abstinence
through nonproblem use to different types and degrees
of problem use. DSM-5 is more aligned with this perspective
but still considers a cutoff indicative of a disorder.
From the alcohol problems continuum perspective,
problems may be exhibited in a variety of forms—
some that are consistent with a formal diagnosis, and
others that are milder or more intermittent. By using an
alcohol problems perspective, the clinician can focus
more clearly on the pattern of drinking, negative consequences
that the client has accumulated, his/her behavioral
excesses and deficits across various areas of
life functioning, and his/her particular strengths. A deemphasis
on diagnosis forces the clinician to consider
clients from a more individual perspective. Therefore,
although formal diagnosis is useful for identifying and
defining the severity of a client’s problems and is necessary
for formal record keeping, the approach to clinical
assessment emphasized in this chapter attends less to
diagnostic issues and more to problem identification.

This chapter views alcohol use problems as a multivariate
set of problems, with alcohol consumption as a
common defining characteristic. These problems vary
in severity from severe alcohol dependence to mild and
circumscribed problems. For some, alcohol consump



Alcohol Use Disorders

tion itself is a major presenting problem; for others,
the consequences of alcohol use—such as disruption
of a relationship, occupational problems, or health
problems—are the major reason for seeking treatment.
In viewing alcohol problems as multivariate, this chapter
also assumes the existence of multiple etiologies
for these problems, with genetic, psychological, and
environmental determinants contributing in differing
degrees for different clients.

Complicating Problems

Drinking problems are complicated by a variety of concomitant
problems. Of significance is the comorbidity
of AUDs with other psychiatric diagnoses. A high
percentage of those diagnosed with an AUD also experience
other psychological problems, which may be
antecedent to, concurrent with, or consequent to their
drinking (Rosenthal, 2013). The most common Axis I
disorders are other SUDs, depression, and anxiety disorders,
occurring in up to 60% of males in treatment.
The most common Axis II disorder comorbid with an
AUD in males is antisocial personality disorder, with
rates ranging from 15 to 50%. Females more often
present with depressive disorders; 25 to 33% of women
with an AUD experience depression prior to the onset
of their AUD.

Alcohol problems also are complicated by problems
with cognition, physical health, interpersonal
relationships, the criminal justice system, the employment
setting, and the environment. Many people with
alcoholism have subtle cognitive deficits, particularly
in the areas of abstract reasoning, memory, cognitive
flexibility, problem solving, and difficulties in emotional
differentiation (for a review of this literature,
see Oscar-Berman & Marinkovi, 2007). Because verbal
functioning is usually unimpaired, these cognitive
problems are not always immediately apparent. Heavy
drinking also causes a variety of medical problems and
can affect any organ system in the body. Heavy drinking
may cause conditions such as cardiomyopathy, liver
diseases, gastritis, ulcers, pancreatitis, and peripheral
neuropathies. Even when obvious medical conditions
are not present, the effects of heavy drinking can be insidious
and debilitating. Many people eat poorly when
drinking, which results in nutritional deficits, poor energy,
or vague and diffuse physical discomfort. Mortality
rates among persons of all ages are elevated with
alcohol dependence, and are higher among women than
among men.

Interpersonal relationships also may be disrupted.
The rates of separation and divorce range up to seven
times those of the general population (Paolino, Mc-
Crady, & Diamond, 1978); spousal violence is higher
among both men and women with AUDs (Smith, Homish,
Leonard, & Cornelius, 2012); and emotional and
behavioral problems are more common among their
spouses/partners and children (Moos & Billings, 1982;
Moos, Finney, & Gamble, 1982). Health care utilization
is elevated among the spouses and children of
actively drinking individuals with AUDs (Spear &
Mason, 1991).

Persons presenting for treatment of a drinking problem
may be involved with the legal system because of
charges related to driving while intoxicated (DWI),
other alcohol-related offenses (e.g., assault), or involvement
with the child welfare system. Drug-related
charges also may bring a client to treatment. Clients
vary in the degree to which they recognize that their
drinking is creating problems, and in their degree of
motivation to change their drinking patterns.

In conclusion, the client presenting for treatment may
be drinking in a manner that creates concern, be formally
diagnosed as having AUD, and also meet criteria
for one or more Axis I or Axis II disorders. The person
also may have other major problems, such as cognitive
impairment, physical health problems, interpersonal or
occupational problems, and/or legal problems. Problem
recognition and motivation to change may be low. How
does the clinician develop a rational approach to conceptualizing
and treating this rather complicated clinical
picture?

TheoreTical Model

The model presented in this chapter assumes that treatment
planning must be multidimensional, and that
there is more than one effective treatment for alcohol
problems. Unlike certain disorders for which one treatment
approach has demonstrable superiority over others,
in the alcohol field there are a number of legitimate
and empirically supported approaches to treatment (for
a review, see Hallgren, Greenfield, Ladd, Glynn, & Mc-
Crady, 2012). These treatments are based in different
conceptualizations of the etiology, course, treatment
goals, and length of treatment for alcohol problems.
Among the treatments with the best support are brief
and motivationally focused interventions, cognitivebehavioral
treatment, 12-step facilitation treatment,


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

behavioral couple therapy, cue exposure treatment, and
the community reinforcement approach. A number of
factors seem to be common to effective treatments.
These are summarized in Table 13.1. A key therapist
responsibility is to help a client find a treatment approach
and treatment setting that is effective for him/
her, rather than slavishly adhering to a particular treatment
model or setting. A second and equally important
therapist responsibility is to enhance the client’s motivation
to continue to try, even if the initial treatment
setting is not effective. This treatment model takes into
account seven major considerations: (1) problem severity,
(2) concomitant life problems, (3) client expectations,
(4) motivation and the therapeutic relationship,

(5) variables maintaining the current drinking pattern,
(6) social support systems, and (7) maintenance of
change.
Problem Severity

Problem severity is relatively atheoretical, and is most
important in decision making about the types of treatments
to be offered, the intensity of the treatment, and
the initial treatment setting. Severe alcohol dependence
can best be conceptualized as a chronic, relapsing disorder
(McLellan, Lewis, O’Brien, & Kleber, 2000),
with relapses occurring even after extended periods
of abstinence. As with other chronic disorders, such
as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or rheumatoid arthritis,
the clinician necessarily takes a long-term perspective,
and maximizing periods of positive functioning
and minimizing periods of problem use should be
the primary goals. In contrast, other individuals have
alcohol-related problems that may be circumscribed
and not progressive (Finney, Moos, & Timko, 2013).
Epidemiological data suggest that for the majority of
those with alcohol-related problems, the problems will
resolve or remit without any need for formal treatment
or intervention. The clinician encountering individuals
at the mild end of the severity spectrum should plan a
brief, motivationally enhancing intervention to complement
the natural change process and inspire these individuals
to make changes in their drinking.

Concomitant Life Problems

Clients with AUDs often have problems in multiple
areas of life functioning—physical, psychological/psychiatric,
familial, social/interpersonal, occupational,
legal, child care, housing, and transportation. Assess


ment of multiple areas of life functioning is crucial
for the planning and delivery of effective treatment.
Research suggests that targeting client problem areas
successfully can result in appreciable changes in these
problems, even with clients who are severely alcohol
dependent and homeless (Cox et al., 1998). Furthermore,
providing treatment directed at multiple problem
areas enhances positive alcohol and drug use outcomes
as well (McLellan et al., 1997; Morgenstern et al., 2006;
Rynes, McCrady, Morgan, Violette, & Pandina, 2012).

Client Expectations

Clinicians should provide clients with accurate expectations
about the intensity of their treatment and the
probable course of their problems. To date, limited research
has examined ways to affect such client expectations,
although the recent development of the Psychosocial
Treatment Expectation Questionnaire suggests that
clients have expectancies about the purpose and atmosphere
of treatment, as well as the likelihood that treatment
will impact their daily lives (Leite, Seminotti,
Freitas, & Drachler, 2011). Because research is limited,
the recommendations provided here derive only partly
from empirical findings about the course and treatment
of AUDs and remain to be tested.

The clinician can inform clients with circumscribed,
less severe problems that treatment will be short in duration,
that they are likely to be successful in reducing
their drinking, and that the long-term prognosis is
good. Such clients also can be told that now or at some
point in the future they may decide to stop drinking
completely (Miller, Leckman, Delaney, & Tinkcom,
1992), or that they may continue to drink in a moderated
fashion.

Clients with more severe and chronic AUDs, however,
should be given a different set of expectations
about treatment and the likely course of their problems.
It is fair to tell them that about 25% of clients maintain
sustained abstinence for at least 1 year after treatment,
that another 10% will use alcohol in moderation and
without problems, that, on average, clients will reduce
the amount they drink by about 87%, and that alcoholrelated
problems will decrease by about 60% (Miller,
Walters, & Bennett, 2001). The challenge for such
clients is to learn skills to manage their drinking in a
way that makes it minimally disruptive to their lives.
Chronic illness metaphors may be helpful. For example,
like a patient with diabetes, a client with a severe
AUD needs to make and maintain significant lifestyle

••
Clear and well organized
••
Actively involve the clients in the program
••
Provide a supportive and emotionally expressive environment
••
Emphasize self-direction, work, and social skills development
••
Expect clients to take responsibility for their treatment and follow through
2. Type of provider and what the provider does
••
Treatment by addictions specialists or mental health clinicians
••
Development of an effective therapeutic alliance is crucial
||Accurate empathy

||Respect for the experience of clients in therapy

||Avoidance of confrontational struggles

••
Provide goal direction for the clients

••
Provide a moderate level of structure for the therapy

••
Handle ambivalence about changing or being in treatment:

||Titrate level of confrontation to the level of clients’ reactance
||Avoid arguing with angry clients
||Avoid pushing clients hard to accept their diagnosis or the need to change

3. Level of care, continuity of care, and elements of treatment
••
Pay attention to retaining clients in treatment
••
Determine the intensity and length of treatment partly by considering the severity of the substance use disorder.
||For heavy drinkers with low alcohol dependence, less intense, briefer treatments are appropriate and
intensive inpatient therapy yields poorer outcomes.
||Clients with severe alcohol dependence have better outcomes with more intensive initial treatment, and
respond most positively to treatment that focuses on 12-step counseling and involvement with 12-step groups.
••
Assess and arrange for attention to clients’ other social service and medical care needs

4. Contextual factors
••
Involve a significant other
••
Help clients restructure their social environments to include persons that support change and abstinence.
••
With clients who have little commitment to remain in treatment or change their substance use, involve the
family or other member of the social support system in the treatment to foster retention in treatment
••
In the treatment of adolescents with substance use disorders, use approaches that involve multiple systems,
including the family, peers, and others

5. Client characteristics
••
Greater client readiness to change is associated with greater treatment success
••
Greater severity of the substance use disorder is associated with a poorer response to treatment
6. Specific therapeutic elements
••
Focus on client motivation
••
Help clients develop awareness of repetitive patterns of thinking and behavior that perpetuate their alcohol or
drug use
••
Attend to the affective experiences of clients
••
Consider the role of conditioning in the development and maintenance of substance use disorders. Clinicians

should carefully assess for indicators of specific conditioned responses to alcohol or drugs, and develop ways to
change these conditioned responses
••
Enhance positive outcome expectancies

7. Client–treatment matching
••
Assess for comorbid disorders and use empirically supported treatments for additional presenting problems
••
Use female-specific treatment with women clients

changes to support healthy functioning. Like the patient
with diabetes, the client with a severe AUD needs
to know warning signs that he/she may be getting into
trouble and know what to do. And neither individual
can afford to forget or ignore his/her chronic problem.

Motivation and the Therapeutic Relationship

Clients vary in the degree to which they recognize
their drinking is problematic and in their readiness to
change. Motivational models suggest that individuals
initiate change when the perceived costs of the behavior
outweigh the perceived benefits, and when they can anticipate
some benefits from behavior change (Cunningham,
Sobell, Sobell, & Gaskin, 1994). Prochaska and
DiClemente (2005) proposed a continuum of stages of
readiness for change. The continuum includes the stages
of “precontemplation,” in which a person does not
recognize a behavior as problematic; “contemplation,”
in which the person considers that a behavior pattern
might be problematic; “determination” or “preparation,”
in which the individual resolves to change; and
“action,” in which a person initiates active behaviors
to deal with the problem. Following “action” is “maintenance,”
if the behavior change is successful, or “relapse,”
if the person returns to the problem behavior.
Miller and Rollnick (2002) suggested that several factors
influence a person’s readiness to change, including
awareness of problem severity, awareness of positive
consequences for changing the behavior, and the perception
of choice in making changes. Clients’ apparent
stage of change and self-perception of their problems
should guide a clinician’s initial approach to treatment
and treatment planning.

Contemporary models view motivation as a state
that can be influenced by therapeutic behaviors and the
client’s life experiences. Therapeutic approaches to enhance
motivation lead clients to talk more about changing
their drinking than continuing to drink, and in turn
this “change talk” predicts better outcomes (Moyers,
Martin, Houck, Christopher, & Tonigan, 2009). Motivationally
enhancing approaches appear to be particularly
effective with clients who enter treatment very
angry and hostile (Project MATCH Research Group,
1997b). Miller and Rollnick (1991) described six common
elements to enhance motivation, summarized in
the acronym FRAMES: personalized feedback (F) to
the client about his/her status; an emphasis on the personal
responsibility (R) of the client for change; provision
of clear advice (A) about the need for change,

given in a supportive manner; providing the client with
a menu (M) of options for how to go about changing,
rather than insisting upon one treatment or treatment
goal; providing treatment in a warm, empathic (E), and
supportive style; and enhancing the client’s perceived
self-efficacy (S) for change.

Factors Maintaining the Current
Drinking Pattern

Case conceptualization for treatment planning focuses
on factors maintaining the problematic drinking pattern.
Different treatment models use different frameworks
for conceptualizing current factors that maintain
drinking. Presented here is a cognitive-behavioral approach
to case conceptualization (see Epstein & Mc-
Crady, 2009). The cognitive-behavioral case formulation
assumes that drinking can best be treated by
examining current factors maintaining drinking rather
than historical factors. Factors maintaining drinking
may be individual, or related to environmental circumstances
or interpersonal relationships. The model assumes
external antecedents to drinking that have a lawful
relationship to drinking through repeated pairings
with positive or negative reinforcement, or through the
anticipation of reinforcement. The model assumes that
cognitions and affective states mediate the relationship
between external antecedents and drinking behavior,
and that expectancies about the reinforcing value of
alcohol play an important role in determining subsequent
drinking behavior. Finally, the model assumes
that drinking is maintained by its consequences, and
that the sources of these consequences may be physiological,
psychological, or interpersonal.

To integrate these assumptions about drinking,
my colleagues and I use a functional analytic framework,
in which the drinking response (R) is elicited
by environmental stimuli (S) that occur antecedent to
drinking; that the relationship between the stimulus
and response is mediated by cognitive, affective, and
physiological, or organismic (O) factors; and that the
response is maintained by positive or the avoidance
of negative consequences (C) as a result of drinking.
Various individual, familial, and other interpersonal
factors are associated with drinking. At the individual
level, environmental antecedents may be associated
with specific drinking situations, times of the day, or
the mere sight or smell of alcohol. Organismic variables
may include craving for alcohol; withdrawal
symptoms; negative affects such as anger, anxiety, or


Alcohol Use Disorders

depression; negative self-evaluations or irrational beliefs;
or positive expectancies about the effects of alcohol
in particular situations. Individual reinforcers may
include decreased craving or withdrawal symptoms,
decreases in negative affect or increases in positive affect,
decreased negative self-evaluations, or decreased
focus on problems and concerns.

At the familial level, various antecedents to drinking
occur. Alcohol may be a usual part of family celebrations
or daily rituals. Family members may attempt to
influence the problematic drinking behavior by nagging
the person to stop or by attempting to control
the drinking through control of the finances or liquor
supply. These actions may become antecedents to further
drinking. Families in which a member is drinking
heavily may develop poor communication and problemsolving
skills, as well as marital/couple, sexual, financial,
and child-rearing problems that then cue further
drinking. The person with the drinking problem may
have a variety of reactions to these familial antecedents,
experiencing negative affect, low self-efficacy
for coping with problems, and/or retaliatory thoughts.
Family behaviors may serve to reinforce the drinking.
The family may shield the person from negative consequences
of drinking by taking care of the drinker when
intoxicated or assuming his/her responsibilities. A
number of investigators have observed positive changes
in marital/couple interactions associated with drinking,
such as increases in intimate exchanges or increased
assertiveness by the drinker, suggesting that these positive
behaviors may reinforce the drinking (e.g., Frankenstein,
Hay, & Nathan, 1985).

There also are other interpersonal antecedents to
drinking. These may include social pressures to drink;
work-related drinking situations; friendships in which
alcohol consumption plays a major role; or interpersonal
conflicts with work associates, friends, or acquaintances.
The person may react to interpersonal
antecedents to drinking with craving, positive expectancies
for alcohol use, social discomfort, or negative
self-evaluations for not drinking. Positive interpersonal
consequences of drinking may include decreased craving
or social anxiety, an enhanced sense of social connectedness
or fun, or increased social comfort or assertiveness.


Social Support

The behaviors of family and other members of the client’s
social network are integral to the case conceptu


alization. The availability of general social support, as
well as social support for abstinence or moderate drinking,
is crucial to successful treatment. Support from the
client’s social network for abstinence is associated with
better drinking outcomes; support for continued drinking
is associated with poorer outcomes (Longabaugh,
Wirtz, Zywiak, & O’Malley, 2010). Clients in a social
network that is strongly supportive of drinking may
need to take deliberate steps to detach from that social
network and access new social networks that support
abstinence or moderate drinking. Some data suggest
that involvement with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) can
serve such a function (Longabaugh, Wirtz, Zweben, &
Stout, 1998), and data on natural recovery from alcohol
problems suggest that finding a new love relationship or
involvement in religious activities also may be viable
avenues for change (Vaillant & Milofsky, 1982).

Maintenance of Change

Implicit in much of the preceding discussion is a view
that individuals with severe AUDs have a high probability
of relapse, an ever-present consideration, both
because long-term, ingrained habits are difficult to
change, and because of the permanent physiological
and metabolic changes stimulated by heavy drinking
(Woodward, 2013). Several models have been proposed
to conceptualize the maintenance or relapse process,
with associated treatments. The most prominent
maintenance models include the relapse prevention
(RP) model (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985; Witkiewitz &
Marlatt, 2004), and the disease model, best exemplified
by the practices common to AA. The RP model,
an extension of the functional-analytic model described
earlier, focuses on the interplay among environment,
coping skills, and cognitive and affective responses
in maintaining successful change. In the RP model,
relapse occurs in response to a high-risk situation for
which the client either lacks or does not apply effective
coping skills. Low self-efficacy for coping with the
situation may contribute to the difficulties. If the client
does not cope effectively, use of alcohol is likely. Marlatt
and Gordon (1985) suggested that, following initial
drinking, a cognitive factor, the “abstinence violation
effect” (AVE), is activated. The AVE represents allor-
nothing thinking; after drinking, the client makes a
cognitive shift to viewing him/herself as “drinking”;
therefore, he/she continues to drink. RP treatment
focuses on several points of intervention common to
cognitive-behavioral treatment, such as identification


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

of high-risk situations and acquisition of coping skills,
as well as cognitive restructuring to help the client view
a drinking episode as a “lapse” from which he/she can
learn and return to abstinence rather than a “relapse”
into previous drinking patterns. RP also focuses on
lifestyle changes to decrease the presence of high-risk
situations, and encourages development of a balance
between pleasures and desires, and obligations and responsibilities
(a “want–should” balance) in the client’s
life. In his more recent work, Marlatt (Marlatt & Donovan,
2005; Witkiewitz & Marlatt, 2004) described relapse
as “multidimensional and dynamic” (Marlatt &
Donovan, 2005, p. 21), and considered the influence of
longer-term risk factors such as family history and social
supports, and well as more proximal influences on
relapse. He also suggested that there are reciprocal interactions
among cognitions, coping skills, affect, and
drinking.

Disease model perspectives view alcoholism as a
chronic, progressive disease that can be arrested but not
cured. Treatment based on the disease model focuses
on helping the client recognize that he/she has this disease,
that abstinence and a lifelong program of recovery
are the only means to arrest the disease, and that
involvement in AA or other 12-step groups is essential
to successful maintenance of change (e.g., Slaymaker
& Sheehan, 2013).

The model presented in this chapter is most closely
allied with the RP model, but clinicians should be
knowledgeable about the disease model underlying AA
and recognize that some clients are drawn to it because
they find the model and the program helpful and relevant
to them.

Overview

The major elements of the treatment model have direct
implications for facilitating problem recognition and
entry into treatment, and for the planning and delivery
of treatment. If an individual has not entered treatment,
there are techniques to help that individual recognize
his/her drinking as problematic and in need of change.
For a client seeking alcohol treatment, the therapist
must make decisions about the most appropriate setting
in which to provide treatment and select the therapeu


tic modalities most appropriate to him/her. Therapeutic
techniques must be tailored to the client’s needs related
to drinking and other life problems. The therapist also
must consider the social context in which drinking occurs,
as well as the social context for change. He/she
must be cognizant of the subtle and nonspecific aspects
of providing treatment to clients with drinking problems
and utilize a therapeutic stance that enhances the
client’s motivation to continue to engage in the change
process. The therapist must attend to the client’s own
views about treatment and change, and provide the client
with accurate long-term expectations about drinking
outcomes. Core components of the treatment model
are listed in Table 13.2.

Case Identification and Entry into Treatment

Before discussing applications of the model to active
treatment, it is important to consider how to help clients
enter the treatment system.

Case Identification and Screening

Many individuals who drink do not think they have
problems related to drinking. They may be unaware of
the high-risk nature of their drinking pattern, or unaware
of the negative consequences that are occurring.
Feeling ashamed or guilty, they may be reluctant to
tell others about their problems, or they may perceive

health care professionals as uninterested or unconcerned
about drinking. Routine queries about drinking
and its consequences in both medical and mental health
care settings can obviate some of these difficulties.
Given the high prevalence of drinking problems among
individuals seeking health and mental health services,
questions about drinking should be part of all clinicians’
intake interviews. The Affordable Care Act will
require screening for alcohol and drug problems of all
patients who are seen in primary care settings. Given
the increased integration of psychological services into
primary care, mental health professionals may take the
lead in introducing appropriate screening tools into
these health care settings.

Many screening interviews and questionnaires have
been developed to identify clients with alcohol problems.
At a minimum, all clients should be asked whether
they drink, and drinkers should be asked follow-up
questions about the quantity and frequency of their
drinking. Drinking should be considered as heavy or
high-risk if a man drinks more than 28 standard drinks
in a week, or a woman drinks more than 21 standard
drinks in a week.1 Concern should also be heightened
if a client reports heavy drinking (five drinks for men,
four for women) twice or more than per month. Followup
questions may be used to inquire about subjective
and objective consequences of drinking. The CAGE
(cut down, annoyed, guilty, eye-opener; Mayfield,
McLeod, & Hall, 1974; see Table 13.3) and the Alcohol
Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Saunders,
Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, & Grant, 1993) are two
useful screening measures. Two affirmative responses
to the CAGE suggest a high probability of an AUD,
but even one positive response warrants further clinical
inquiry. The AUDIT includes both direct and subtle
approaches to alcohol screening; therefore, it may be
useful with clients who are reluctant to self-identify
drinking problems. The CAGE and AUDIT questions
are reproduced in Table 13.3.

Motivating a Drinker to Enter Treatment

The initial challenge for a clinician is to stimulate the
client to initiate any change. Methods for motivating
clients to enter treatment vary; a clinician may draw
upon motivational interviewing techniques (Miller &
Rollnick, 2002), may involve family and concerned
others in collaborative, client-centered work (Miller,
Meyers, & Tonigan, 1999; Smith & Meyers, 2004), or

may use confrontational approaches, such as an “intervention”
(Liepman, 1993). Implementation of motivational
principles and techniques in ongoing clinical
practice, however, presents creative challenges to the
clinician. Three examples illustrate the application of
different approaches to motivating clients to enter treatment.


Bill was a retired chemist with a long history of
heavy drinking, multiple phobias, and bipolar disorder.
I was initially contacted by his wife Diana, who told
me that her husband had a 20-year drinking history,
that his drinking had increased since his retirement,
and that she did not know what to do: The children
were angry and threatening to break off contact with
him; she and Bill were arguing frequently; and she was
beginning to feel increasingly anxious and depressed
herself. Diana had consulted with a certified addictions
counselor, who told her that they should set up
an “intervention”—a meeting in which Diana and the
children would confront Bill about his drinking, insist
that he get treatment, then take him directly to an inpatient
treatment facility. When Diana was hesitant, the
counselor told her she was codependent and enabling
him. She left the counselor’s office discouraged, certain
that she did not want to initiate an intervention, but also
certain that something should be done. I tried the most
minimal intervention first. Over the telephone, I suggested
that Diana speak with Bill one morning (before
he had begun drinking) and say, “Bill, I am concerned
about your drinking. I have spoken with a psychologist
who specializes in alcohol treatment, and she said that
she would be happy to see you for an evaluation. At
the end of the evaluation, she’ll give us feedback about
what we could do.” I told her not to elaborate on this
statement, but simply to respond to Bill’s questions. If
he refused, she was to get back in touch with me.

I next heard from Diana a month later. Bill had
refused her request, and she wondered what else she
could do. I suggested an individual consultation with
me to discuss how to change her own actions to motivate
Bill toward change. Diana came in, and after some
further assessment of both Bill’s drinking history and
her current functioning, I suggested three basic behavioral
strategies, which I drew from Thomas’s unilateral
family therapy (Thomas, Yoshioka, & Ager, 1996)
and the community reinforcement and family training
(CRAFT) model (Smith & Meyers, 2004). First, I instructed
Diana to leave Bill to his drinking as much as
possible, to let negative consequences occur naturally.

Second, I encouraged her to give him factual feedback
about negative behaviors related to his drinking, but
only at times when he was sober. The structure of the
feedback was as follows: “Bill, I am concerned that X
happened last night when you were drinking.” Third, I
encouraged her to spend time with him in positive pursuits
when he was not drinking. Given that they were
going to Florida for the winter, I suggested that just before
they returned, she should repeat her request that he
come to see me for an evaluation.

I next heard from Diana in the spring, when she
called me to make an appointment for the two of them
to come in for an evaluation. They both attended. What
follows is our initial discussion.2 (In this and other dialogues
in this chapter, I am the therapist.)

tHeraPist: I’m so glad to get to meet you. As you
know, Diana first spoke with me a few months ago,
so I feel as though I know you a bit. I understand
that you were initially reluctant to come in, and I’m
pleased that you decided to come. How did that come
about?

Bill: Well, Diana asked me, and I know she’s been
concerned, so I agreed. But I only agreed to come to-
day—I’m not making any kind of commitment here.

tHeraPist: I understand that and certainly won’t try
to push you to do anything you’re not comfortable
with. What I’d like to do today is to get a better understanding
about your drinking and the kinds of
problems it might be causing. At the end of our time
together, I’ll give you some feedback and we can discuss
some options for you, if you decide you want to
make any changes. If I ask you anything that you’re
not comfortable answering, just let me know. OK?

Bill was visibly uncomfortable, and pushed his chair
as far back into the corner of my office as possible. He
sat with his body turned away from Diana and often
looked up at the ceiling or sighed when she was speaking.
Despite his visible discomfort, he gave a clear account
of his drinking. He had been drinking heavily
for the past 25 years, and at one point had been drinking
a pint of Jack Daniels whiskey each evening. He
was diagnosed with colon cancer in his early 60s and
treated surgically. Since the surgery, he had been concerned
about his health and had attempted to reduce his
drinking. His current pattern was almost daily drinking,
in the evenings, ranging from two to four bottles of

Grolsch beer to an occasional (approximately twice per
month) pint of Jack Daniels. He reported no withdrawal
symptoms on days when he did not drink, and no apparent
medical sequelae of his drinking. He said that he
did not feel that he had control over his drinking, and
expressed sadness that Diana was so upset. His love for
her, apparent in his speech and demeanor, was clearly
the primary reason he had come to see me.

Given Bill’s discomfort, I did not try to complete any
standardized assessment instruments or even to structure
the initial interview as I might have with other clients.
Instead, I followed his lead, made frequent comments
reflecting the emotions he was expressing, and
at times asked Diana not to interrupt, so that Bill could
express himself. In the last 15 minutes of the 1-hour
interview, we shifted to feedback and discussion:

tHeraPist: I’d like to stop asking you so many questions
now, and see if we can talk about possible options.
I am glad that you came in and appreciate that
this was not easy for you. From what you and Diana
have told me, it does seem that it makes sense to be
concerned about your drinking. The amount you’re
drinking is above the recommended levels for safe
and healthy drinking; you are concerned by your
own feelings of lack of control; and your drinking
has been upsetting to your family, which is painful
to you. What do you think?

Bill: I guess talking about all of this at once makes it
clearer that I’m drinking too much. I don’t want to
stop, though—I appreciate good beer, and look forward
to having a bottle or two in the evening. I just
don’t want to overdo it to the point of hurting Diana.

tHeraPist: So you are concerned and think that some
kind of change makes sense, but you’re not sure exactly
what those changes should be?

Bill: Exactly.

tHeraPist: I think you have a number of options.
Making some kind of change makes sense given
the problems we’ve discussed. Probably your safest
choice is to stop drinking—you can’t create future
health problems from drinking if you don’t drink,
and in some ways it might be easiest given that
you’re in a pretty daily routine of drinking now. But
if you don’t want to stop, we could also work toward
your reducing your drinking to a level that is safer
and healthier, and one that Diana and your children
are comfortable with. I’d be willing to work with you


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

to try to reach that goal. I don’t think that you need
intensive treatment in a hospital program right now,
but you would probably benefit from some help to
make changes. What do you think?

Bill: I’m surprised that you think I could reduce my

drinking. I have to think about this. I’ll have Diana

get back to you.

The discussion continued with input from Diana as
well, and the session ended with a commitment only to
think about our discussion. Several days later, Diana
called to indicate that Bill wanted to begin treatment
with me, and we scheduled an appointment.

Dorothy, a 78-year-old, widowed, retired schoolteacher,
was hospitalized at a local medical center after
a fall in her apartment. Her blood alcohol level (BAL)
on admission was 185 mg%, and she had extensive evidence
of old bruises, as well as a dislocated shoulder
and broken wrist from the fall. She was immediately
started on medication for alcohol withdrawal, and our
addictions consultation team was called in to see her
on the second day of her hospitalization. Dorothy’s son
John was in the room when I came to see her. With
his assistance, I was able to obtain a lengthy history
of alcohol consumption that dated back to her early
40s. Although Dorothy had wanted to stop drinking,
she had never been successful for more than a few days
at a time, and had never received any form of alcohol
treatment. Since her husband’s death 2 years earlier,
she had been consuming a pint bottle of blackberry
brandy each day. She had completely withdrawn from
her previous social activities with friends, her hygiene
had deteriorated, and she had had multiple accidents in
her house. Dorothy provided this information tearfully,
expressing a great sense of shame about her behavior.
John described her home as “a mess” and said that he
was angry and disgusted with her. Dorothy’s family
history revealed many family members with alcohol
dependence, including her father, two brothers, and a
maternal uncle. Despite the medication, she showed
visible signs of alcohol withdrawal during the interview.
Dorothy was tearful and stated repeatedly that
she was a “sinful, bad” person. My interviewing style
with her was empathic: I asked her about her concerns,
inquired how she felt, and reflected back her obvious
distress with her current situation. I then told her that
there were treatments available to help people with
problems like hers. Her immediate and strong reaction
was to say that she was too bad, and that her drinking

was a sin. Although not usually a strong proponent of
labeling alcohol dependence as a disease, I decided that
this framework might in fact be acceptable and supportive
to her. Given her long history of alcohol dependence
with physiological dependence, and her heavy
family history of alcohol dependence, such a framework
seemed plausible and appropriate.

“Dorothy, it is clear to me that you are very, very
upset by your drinking and by all the problems it has
caused for you and your family. I understand that
you blame yourself and seem to think your drinking
shows that you are a bad person. There is another
way of thinking about your drinking that I’d like to
tell you about. You may or may not agree with me,
but I hope you’ll think about what I say. Some people
say that alcoholism is a disease. In your case, I think
that is true. You probably have genes that made you
very vulnerable to alcohol—your father, your uncle,
and your brothers all seem to have the same disease.
We know that the vulnerability to alcoholism can be
inherited, and I would guess that you inherited it.
Over time, your body has become adapted to your
drinking—it is more comfortable with alcohol than
without it. If you try to stop, your body reacts badly.
The shaking and nausea that you’re experiencing
now are signs that your body has become hooked on
alcohol.

“What does all this mean? It means that your body
reacts differently to alcohol than other people’s, and
probably has from the beginning of your drinking. It
is no more your fault that you have a drinking problem
than it is the fault of a diabetic that her body
can’t make insulin. People are not responsible for
the diseases they develop. But they are responsible
for making the decision to take care of their disease,
for getting help, and for following the advice of the
people who give them that help. Except for the problems
your drinking has caused, you’re healthy, and
you obviously have people who care about you. If
you can get help, you have a good chance of getting
better.”

Dorothy initially was skeptical of this reframing of
her problems. Without my prompting, when her son
left the hospital that day, he picked up some brochures
about alcoholism as a disease and brought them back
for his mother to read. When I came to see her the next
day, she had many questions about this disease notion
and about treatment, which I answered as factually as


Alcohol Use Disorders

possible, still maintaining a motivational interviewing
stance—not trying to push her into treatment, but
reflecting her interest and concern. By my third visit,
she agreed to enter a treatment program. She entered a
short-term residential rehabilitation program, followed
by longer-term outpatient group therapy. She began
to volunteer at the hospital where I first saw her, and
she remained sober and an active volunteer for several
years, until advancing age required that she retire.

Dennis was a 41-year-old dentist with a history of
abuse of alcohol, prescription opiates, and benzodiazepines.
Dennis’s case illustrates the need for a full
armamentarium of clinical techniques to motivate individuals
to enter treatment. At the time that I saw Dennis,
our center had a contract with the state dental association
to provide assessment, motivation, referral, and
monitoring services for dentists with alcohol and drug
problems. I was called about Dennis on a Friday afternoon
by an emergency room physician. Dennis had
taken an overdose of medications and had been rushed
to the emergency room by his office staff. His condition
had been stabilized, and he was now insisting that he
leave the hospital. The physician wanted our program
to “do something.” In rapid succession, I received calls
from the office staff, from Dennis’s wife, and from another
dentist, who had been serving as his AA sponsor.
By telephone, they provided me with a horrific history
of abuse of multiple substances, domestic violence,
canceled afternoons of appointments with patients, extraction
of the wrong tooth from a patient, and repeated
failures in AA and outpatient treatment. Each caller described
Dennis as intractable, and all were desperately
concerned that he would kill himself. I asked them all
to meet me at the hospital, and left my office to join
them there. I informed the emergency room physician
that I would be coming to the hospital, and asked him
to hold Dennis there until I arrived.

When I arrived at the hospital, I first spoke with
Dennis individually. He was alert, oriented, belligerent
and angry, and utterly unwilling to speak with me at
any length or to agree to any kind of plan of care. My
best motivational interviewing skills failed completely
with him. Given the crisis nature of the situation and
his extremely severe SUD, I decided to utilize a more
confrontational technique—the intervention (Liepman,
1993). Interventions are designed to confront the resistant
client and create a forced plan of action. Research
suggests that two-thirds of families will not follow
through with an intervention (as was the case with Diana
and Bill), but that if an intervention is implemented,

the probability of the client’s entering treatment is very
high (Miller et al., 1999). I gathered the office staff,
Dennis’s wife, and his AA sponsor together and asked
them whether they would be willing to sit down to talk
with Dennis about his problems. They were relieved
and eager to do so. We spent about 30 minutes together,
during which time I outlined the basic requirements
for the intervention: (1) Each person’s feedback should
begin with an expression of caring or concern; (2) each
should provide concrete, behavioral feedback related to
Dennis’s drinking and drug use (e.g., mentioning his
canceling appointments rather than saying he was irresponsible);
(3) at the end of his/her feedback, each person
should repeat the expression of concern and request
that Dennis get help. We then sat down with Dennis,
and each person spoke. Dennis began to cry and after a
lengthy period of time agreed that he needed help and
would follow my recommendations for treatment.

Assessment

Once a client has entered treatment, the therapist should
begin with an initial assessment of drinking, other drug
use, and problems in other areas of life functioning.
(Donovan, 2013, provides a comprehensive description
of assessment for SUDs; Green, Worden, Menges, &
McCrady, 2008, provide an evaluation of the psychometric
properties of various assessment instruments for
AUDs). Assessment of motivation, as well as resources
that the client brings to the treatment, is important. If
the therapist provides cognitive-behavioral treatment,
assessment for a functional analysis of drinking is necessary.
If the client’s spouse/partner or other family
members are involved in the treatment, their role in the
drinking, as well as overall relationship functioning,
should be assessed.

Drinking Assessment

The clinical interview is used to assess drinking history
and client perceptions of his/her current drinking.
Major topics to cover in the clinical interview are outlined
in Table 13.4. Typically, we use a handheld breath
alcohol tester at the beginning of each session to assess
current BAL. In addition to the clinical interview,
two structured interviews—the Timeline Follow-Back
Interview (TLFB; Sobell & Sobell, 1995), designed to
assess drinking and drug use behavior each day in a
set window of time before treatment; and the alcohol
and drug sections of the Structured Clinical Interview

needed to establish a formal diagnosis. Alternative
structured interviews, such as the Form-90
(Tonigan, Miller, & Brown, 1997), may be used to obtain
information about drinking history, patterns, and
consequences of use. Self-report measures may be used
to assess severity of alcohol dependence (the Alcohol
Dependence Scale [ADS]; Skinner & Allen, 1982) and
negative consequences of drinking (the Drinker Inventory
of Consequences [DrInC] or the Short Inventory
of Problems [SIP]; Miller, Tonigan, & Longabaugh,
1995).

Assessment of Other Problem Areas

The clinician can draw from a wide variety of measures
to assess other life problems. Assessment may
range from unstructured interviews to the use of simple
problem checklists to formal interviewing techniques.
The Addiction Severity Index (ASI; McLellan et al.,
1992) is a widely used measure of client functioning
across multiple domains; subscales include Medical,
Psychological, Family/Social, Legal, Employment,
Alcohol, and Drug. The ASI is in the public domain,
and the instrument, instructions, and scoring programs
can be downloaded from http://triweb.tresearch.org/
index.php/tools/download-asi-instruments-manuals.
The ASI can be administered as an interview in about
45 minutes, and computer-assisted interview versions
are available. The ASI, however, does not provide diagnostic
information for any psychological disorders,
and the cautious clinician should use formal diagnostic
screening questions to assess for the possible presence
of other psychological disorders.

Assessment of Motivation

Assessment of motivation should consider (1) reasons
why the client is seeking treatment, with careful attention
to external factors involved with help seeking; (2)
the client’s treatment goals; (3) the client’s readiness
to change; and (4) the degree to which the client sees
negative consequences of his/her current drinking pattern
and envisions positive consequences of change.
Clinical interviewing provides information about reasons
for seeking treatment, and drinking goals may be
assessed either by asking the client directly or by using

Functional Analysis

Two assessment techniques may be used to identify
antecedents to drinking. A self-report questionnaire,
the Drinking Patterns Questionnaire (DPQ; Menges,
McCrady, Epstein, & Beem, 2008), lists potential environmental,
cognitive, affective, interpersonal, and
intrapersonal antecedents to drinking or drinking
urges. The Inventory of Drinking Situations (Annis,
Graham, & Davis, 1987), a shorter measure that assesses
situations in which a client drinks heavily, also is
available. Daily self-recording cards (Figure 13.3) are
used throughout the treatment to record clients’ drinks
and drinking urges. Discussing events associated with
drinking or drinking urges can help both client and clinician
to develop a clearer picture of drinking antecedents
and consequences. Self-recording cards also allow
the clinician to track progress in terms of quantity and
frequency of drinking, as well as frequency and intensity
of urges to drink.

Partner Assessment

Questionnaires and self-recording cards can be used
to assess how the client’s partner has coped with the
drinking. Each day, the partner who is involved with
treatment records his/her perceptions of the drinker’s

drinking and drinking urges on a Likert scale (None,
Light, Moderate, or Heavy; see Figure 13.4). In addition,
the partner may complete the Coping Questionnaire
(Orford, Templeton, Velleman, & Copello, 2005)
to describe the variety of ways the partner has tried to
cope with drinking. These include engaged, tolerant–
inactive, and withdrawal coping. It also is important to
assess other aspects of the couple’s relationship, if both
partners are to be involved in treatment. The Areas
of Change Questionnaire (ACQ; Margolin, Talovic,
& Weinstein, 1983) and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale
(DAS; Spanier, 1976) are excellent self-report measures
of relationship problems and satisfaction. The Revised
Conflict Tactics Scales (Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy,
& Sugarman, 1996) provides a succinct measure of relationship
conflict, including physical violence.

Selection of Treatment Setting

Information from the assessment of drinking, concomitant
problem areas, and motivation is used to determine
the appropriate setting in which to initiate treatment. As
with other areas of health and mental health care, the
principle of least restrictive level of care should apply
to alcohol and drug treatment. Residential rehabilitation
of fixed length (usually 28–30 days) historically

was seen as the treatment of choice. However, studies
comparing the effectiveness of different levels of care
(e.g., see Fink et al., 1985; Longabaugh et al., 1983;
McCrady et al., 1986) have found that most clients can
be treated effectively in an ambulatory treatment setting,
and health care insurers typically require preauthorization
of episodes of care. Outpatient treatment is
the predominant form of treatment, with the ratio of
clients seen in outpatient versus inpatient treatment at
about 10:1 (Roman, 2013).

Both the Institute of Medicine (1990) and Sobell and
Sobell (2000) have proposed stepped-care models for
making decisions about level of care. The stepped-care
model proposes brief interventions as the modal initial
approach to treatment, with treatment “stepped up” to
more intensive or extensive treatment based on the client’s
response to the initial treatment. Such models are
economically conservative and maintain the principle
of least restrictive level of care. However, some clients
with more severe problems might not be served well by
very brief treatment (e.g., Rychtarik et al., 2000), and
studies using American Society of Addiction Medicine
(ASAM) criteria suggest that patients have poorer outcomes
if they receive less intensive treatment than suggested
by these criteria (Magura et al., 2003).

Proposed decision-making models to determine
level of care have been implemented in many states.
The ASAM (2001) has proposed a multidimensional
decision-making model for selecting initial level of
care. ASAM criteria consider need for supervised withdrawal,
medical conditions that might require monitoring,
comorbid psychiatric conditions, motivation for

change and degree of treatment acceptance or resistance,
relapse potential, and nature of the individual’s
social environment in recommending an initial level of
care. These criteria are mapped onto five major levels
of care, including early intervention, outpatient, intensive
outpatient/partial hospitalization, residential/inpatient,
and medically managed intensive inpatient treatment.
Table 13.5 summarizes how the major criteria are
applied to level of care determinations. Studies of the
ASAM criteria suggest a number of barriers to using
the criteria in clinical practice. For example, among
homeless individuals, treatment facilities may be inaccessible
because of lack of insurance or money to pay.
Also, such individuals often are placed on waiting lists
because programs are full. Some programs also may
lack adjunctive services needed by a homeless population,
such as assistance with pragmatic issues (food
stamps, housing, unemployment, medical care, mental
health care, or family treatment) (O’Toole et al., 2004).
Among other patients seeking alcohol treatment, some
may receive treatment that is more intensive than that
suggested by ASAM criteria because their insurance
or Medicaid only covers inpatient treatment, there may
have been pressure from the family for inpatient treatment,
or a specific level of care was mandated by an
external agency (e.g., Employee Assistance Program).
Patients also may receive treatment that is less intensive
than that suggested by ASAM criteria because of
their work schedule or reluctance to commit to more
(Kosanke, Magura, Staines, Foote, & DeLuca, 2002).
Additional considerations in determining initial level
of care are discussed below.

Need for Detoxification

If a client is physically dependent on alcohol, then
he/she will experience alcohol withdrawal symptoms
when drinking is decreased or stopped. A number of
signs suggest that a client may be physically dependent
on alcohol, including daily drinking, drinking regularly
or intermittently throughout the day, and morning
drinking. Awakening during the night with fears,
trembling, or nausea, or experiencing such symptoms
upon first awakening, also suggests dependence. Cessation
or a substantial decrease in drinking will result
in the appearance of minor withdrawal symptoms, such
as tremulousness, nausea, vomiting, difficulty sleeping,
irritability, anxiety, and elevations in pulse rate,
blood pressure, and temperature. Such symptoms usually
begin within 5–12 hours. More severe withdrawal
symptoms (e.g., seizures, delirium, or hallucinations)
may also occur, usually within 24–72 hours of the ces


sation of drinking. If a client has not consumed alcohol
for several days prior to initial clinical contact, concerns
about alcohol withdrawal are not relevant. If the client
has stopped drinking within the last 3 days, the clinician
needs to inquire about and observe the client for
signs of withdrawal. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal
Assessment (CIWA, Sullivan, Sykora, Schneiderman,
Naranjo, & Sellers, 1989) provides an objective measure
of current withdrawal symptoms. If the client currently
is drinking, the clinician must rely on drinking
history, pattern, and the results of previous attempts to
stop drinking to determine whether detoxification will
be necessary.

If the client needs detoxification, five alternatives
are available: inpatient or partial hospital medical detoxification,
inpatient nonmedical detoxification, or
outpatient medical or nonmedical detoxification. Inpatient,
medically assisted detoxification is essential if


Alcohol Use Disorders

the client has a history of disorientation, delirium, hallucinations,
or seizures during alcohol withdrawal, or
is showing current signs of disorientation, delirium, or
hallucinations. If the client does not believe that he/she
can stop drinking without being physically removed
from alcohol, but does not show any major withdrawal
signs, is in good health, and does not abuse other drugs,
a social setting detoxification may be appropriate. If
the client has some social supports, then detoxification
can be initiated on a partial hospital or outpatient
basis. The choice between these two latter settings is
determined by how much support the person will need
during withdrawal, and whether a structured program
will be needed after detoxification. If the client needs
a fairly structured program, then the partial hospital is
the preferred setting for detoxification. If a client has
a mild to moderate AUD, a program to reduce alcohol
consumption gradually over several weeks also can be
managed (Cohn et al., 2010).

Medical Problems

The clinician who is considering the best setting for
detoxification should take into account the presence of
other medical problems. A cautious approach dictates
that every client should have both a thorough physical
examination and blood and urine studies at the beginning
of treatment. The clinician should routinely include
questions about physical health in the first contact
with a client, and if significant physical complaints
are noted, the client should receive immediate medical
attention. Some clients have medical problems that require
hospitalization; if so, the hospitalization should
initiate the treatment.

Treatment History

After physical health issues have been considered, the
clinician should examine the client’s previous treatment
history. Questions to consider include the following:


1. Has the client attempted outpatient treatment in
the past and been able to stop or decrease drinking
successfully? If so, then another attempt at
outpatient treatment may be indicated.
2. Has the client dropped out of outpatient treatment
in the past? If so, and there is no indication
that any variables have changed in the interim,
then a more intensive partial hospital or inpatient
program should be considered.

3. Has the client dropped out of, or drunk repeatedly,
while in a partial hospital program? If so,
then inpatient treatment may be indicated.
4. Did the client relapse immediately after discharge
from an inpatient program? If so, then a
partial hospital or outpatient setting may be appropriate
because relapse may have been associated
with problems in generalization from the inpatient
to the natural environment. Alternatively,
a halfway house may be considered to provide a
longer-term structured environment.
Previous Quit Attempts

Many clients have successfully decreased or stopped
drinking on their own at some time. Outpatient treatment
is more likely to be successful for a client with a
history of stopping successfully on his/her own than for
a client without any history of successful change.

Social Support Systems

Social support systems are a critical variable to consider
in determining the appropriate setting for initial treatment.
If a client has support from another person, and
that person is perceived as an important source who is
willing to provide support and reinforcement, then the
client is a good candidate for ambulatory treatment. If
the client is lacking in social support, or is in an environment
that supports heavy drinking, then inpatient or
partial hospital treatment may be advisable. Alternatively,
a halfway house may provide a good treatment
setting for persons who do not have current social supports
and have not been successful at developing them
in the past, even during periods of abstinence.

Personal Resources

The next area to consider encompasses the client’s personal
psychological resources. Has he/she been successful
in other areas of life in setting goals, changing
behavior, and completing tasks? If so, outpatient
treatment is more feasible. Another aspect of personal
resources is cognitive functioning. If the client shows
significant cognitive deficits in memory, attention, abstraction,
or problem solving, a higher level of care may
be considered. Otherwise, the client may have difficul



CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

ty with retaining information presented in treatment or
generating successful ways to avoid drinking.

Other Psychological Problems

As noted earlier in the chapter, persons with drinking
problems often have other, significant psychological
problems. The clinician must not only assess these
problems but also determine level of care based on the
appropriate setting for treatment of these other problems.
A client who presents with serious depression
must be assessed for suicidality and appropriate precautions
should be taken.

Attitudes about Treatment

Although difficult areas to assess, the client’s commitment
to treatment and desire to change are important
factors in selecting level of care. The client who is ambivalent
but willing to come to treatment may respond
better to a more intensive program that provides higher
density reinforcement for attending treatment and making
changes. However, sometimes ambivalence makes
it impossible to provide treatment in a more intensive
setting because the client is unwilling to disrupt his/her
life to the extent required for such a program.

Practical Concerns

There are a number of practical concerns that the clinician
must consider. Although in certain therapeutic
approaches these issues might be considered evidence
of client “denial,” I view practical matters as real barriers
to treatment and work with the client to overcome
these barriers. Some practical barriers revolve around
employment—whether the client can get time off from
work, whether the job is in jeopardy, whether the employer
is willing to support treatment, or whether missing
any more work would result in termination of employment.


A second concern is the client’s financial condition.
Can the client afford to take time off from work and
experience a reduction in income while he/she collects
temporary disability (if sick time is not available)? If not,
outpatient treatment, or a partial hospital program that allows
the person to work, is appropriate. Another financial
concern is the client’s ability to pay for treatment.

Other practical concerns revolve around transportation
and child care. Can the client get to outpatient ap


pointments? Does he/she have a driver’s license, and
if not, is other transportation available? Is child care
available if the person has to be hospitalized? If not, a
day treatment setting may be preferred. The clinician
must consider a range of pragmatic barriers to treatment.


Personal Preferences

Finally, the client’s own preferences about the treatment
must be considered carefully. If the client feels
strongly about wanting to be in a hospital or residential
treatment program, the clinician should listen carefully
to this request, even if the initial assessment suggests
that outpatient treatment may be feasible. Similarly,
if the client wants outpatient treatment, the clinician
should perhaps attempt it, even if he/she believes that a
more intensive treatment is preferable.

General Considerations

In general, the selection of the initial treatment setting
must be seen as a tentative decision. Often an initial
contract may be established that includes the client’s
preferred setting, but with specification of the circumstances
that will dictate a different level of care. For
example, if the clinician believes that the client will
find it extremely difficult to discontinue drinking on
an outpatient basis, but this is the client’s desire, then
an initial contract may involve a plan for reducing or
stopping drinking, learning skills to support that plan,
and a time limit. If the person is unsuccessful within
the specified time frame, then the contract is reviewed
and alternative settings are considered. Thus, although
the initial setting decision is important, continuing to
consider and discuss other treatment settings is an important
early step in the treatment process.

Selection of Treatment Modalities

If a client is referred to inpatient, residential, or intensive
outpatient treatment, a mixture of treatment modalities
is included in the treatment. Six major treatment
modalities are available for the provision of
alcohol treatment: self-help groups, individual therapy,
group therapy, couple therapy, family therapy, and intensive
treatment programs. In the ambulatory setting,
the clinician has more flexibility in selecting from
among these treatment modalities.


Alcohol Use Disorders

Self-Help Groups

AA is the most commonly utilized self-help group.
With groups in all 50 states, as well as more than 150
countries throughout the world, AA is widely available.
It offers a specific approach to recovery, rooted in the
view that alcoholism is a physical, emotional, and spiritual
disease that can be arrested but not cured. Recovery
is viewed as a lifelong process that involves working
the 12 Steps of AA and abstaining from the use
of alcohol (for a detailed description of AA, see Mc-
Crady, Horvath, & Delaney, 2003). The only requirement
for membership in AA is a desire to stop drinking,
and members do not have to pay dues or join the
organization. Persons who become involved with AA
usually attend different meetings; have a relationship
with an AA sponsor who helps them with their recovery;
and become involved with other AA-related activities,
ranging from making the coffee before meetings to
going on “commitments,” in which members of one AA
group speak at another group. More active involvement
is correlated with more successful change (reviewed in
McCrady & Tonigan, in press).

Research suggests that persons most likely to affiliate
with AA have a history of using social supports as
a way to cope with problems, experience loss of control
over their drinking, drink more per occasion than
persons who do not affiliate, experience more anxiety
about their drinking, believe that alcohol enhances
their mental functioning, and are more religious or
spiritual (McCrady & Tonigan, in press). Outpatient
treatment to facilitate involvement with AA (12-step
facilitation) has been found to be as effective as other
forms of outpatient therapy in controlled trials, and
some evidence suggests that clients receiving 12-step
facilitation are more likely to maintain total abstinence
from alcohol than clients receiving more behaviorally
oriented treatments (Project MATCH Research Group,
1997a). Twelve-step facilitation treatment appears to
be particularly successful for individuals with social
systems that support them in drinking heavily (Longabaugh
et al., 1998).

Alternative self-help groups have developed in recent
years. Self-Management and Recovery Training
(SMART) is a self-help approach based largely on
cognitive-behavioral principles. SMART offers several
steps to recovery, emphasizing awareness of irrational
beliefs, self-perceptions, and expectancies as
core to successful change. SMART suggests abstinence
as a preferred drinking goal but emphasizes personal

choice. Secular Organizations for Sobriety/Save Ourselves
(SOS) was developed largely in response to the
spiritual aspects of AA and does not invoke a Higher
Power as a part of the change process. Women for Sobriety,
a self-help approach for women, emphasizes
women’s issues such as assertiveness, self-confidence,
and autonomy as a part of the change process. Moderation
Management (2006) draws on behavioral principles
to accomplish moderate drinking outcomes. All
of these alternative approaches are more compatible
with behavioral approaches than is AA, but none are as
widely available to clients.

Individual Treatment

Individual therapy is offered primarily on an outpatient
basis. Few data are available to guide the choice of individual
versus group therapy. The literature on women
with alcoholism is replete with suggestions that women
respond better to individual than to group therapy, but
empirical support for that assertion is lacking. Similar
assertions apply to the treatment of older persons who
have alcoholism, with a similar lack of empirical support.


Group Therapy

There is a strong belief in the alcohol field that group
therapy is preferable to individual therapy (but see
the previous comments in regard to women and older
adults). Group therapy is more economical to provide,
and interaction among group members provides opportunities
for modeling, feedback, and behavioral rehearsal
that are less available in the individual setting.
Behavioral models for providing group therapy (Monti,
Kadden, Rohsenow, Cooney, & Abrams, 2002; Sobell
& Sobell, 2011) are well documented. Clients who are
able to function in a group setting and do not require
intensive individual attention because of other psychological
problems can be assigned to group therapy.

Couple Therapy

A number of studies have suggested that involving the
spouse/partner in alcoholism treatment increases the
probability of a positive treatment outcome (McCrady,
Epstein, Cook, Jensen, & Hilderbrand, 2009; McCrady,
Owens, & Brovko, 2013). Despite the empirical evidence,
traditional alcoholism counselors prefer individ



CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

ual or group therapy over couple therapy, emphasizing
the importance of a focus on personal change before relationship
change. Models for treatments that integrate
individual and relationship treatment are available
(McCrady & Epstein, 2009). Couple therapy is most
appropriate for clients who have a stable relationship in
which the partner is willing to be involved in treatment
and can function in a supportive manner in the early
phases of treatment. Couples who have experienced severe
domestic violence, or in which one partner’s commitment
to the relationship is highly ambivalent, are
less appropriate for couple therapy.

Techniques also have been developed to provide
treatment to partners of people with AUDs when the
drinker will not seek help. Behavioral groups that emphasize
personal decision making, communication, and
limit-setting around drinking are effective in motivating
individuals to seek treatment or to decrease drinking
(Miller et al., 1999; Sisson & Azrin, 1986; Smith &
Meyers, 2004; Thomas, Santa, Bronson, & Oyserman,
1987). Al-Anon offers a self-help approach to partners
and other family members affected by alcoholism.

Family Therapy

Despite a strong interest in AUDs in the family therapy
field, models for working with whole families in
which an AUD is present are scarce. Within the selfhelp
area, Alateen is available for teens affected by a
family member’s alcoholism, and Alatot is available for
younger family members.

Intensive Treatment Programs

Although, technically, a treatment setting rather than
a modality, intensive treatment programs have such a
specific and defined role in alcohol treatment that they
can be considered a treatment modality. The “Minnesota
model” (Slaymaker & Sheehan, 2013) is an intensive
treatment approach that includes group therapy,
education, self-help group involvement, and some individual
counseling. Programs based on the Minnesota
model emphasize confrontation of denial, acceptance
that one is an alcoholic who is powerless over alcohol,
development of caring and interdependent relationships,
and commitment to AA involvement. Over time,
Minnesota model programs have incorporated many
behavioral strategies and techniques, including social
skills and relaxation training, as well as RP techniques.
Minnesota model programs have been marketed as

the most effective approach to alcoholism treatment,
but data to support these claims are lacking. Most research
on these programs has involved the evaluation
of a single treatment program, and all the evaluations
have been of private treatment centers. The evaluations
suggest substantial levels of abstinence among persons
receiving treatment (see, e.g., Filstead, 1991; Stinchfield
& Owen, 1998), but the subjects in these studies
tend to be good-prognosis patients, and without appropriate
controls, conclusions cannot be drawn about the
relative efficacy of these treatments compared to other
approaches. Slaymaker and Sheehan (2013) reviewed
more recent experimental and quasi-experimental studies
of intensive treatments based on the disease model
that were similar to Minnesota model programs, concluding
that these studies supported the efficacy of the
treatment model. Their wide visibility has made them
the choice of many individuals with alcoholism and
their families.

Enhancing and Maintaining Motivation
to Change

Once a decision has been made about the level of
care and the client has entered treatment, the clinician
needs to continue to focus on motivation to be in
treatment and to change. Techniques to enhance motivation
include feedback, use of motivational interviewing
techniques, mutual goal setting and decision
making, treatment contracting, and the instillation of
hope. Three clinical examples illustrate some of these
techniques.

Bill (described earlier in this chapter) began treatment
quite tentatively. He was willing to complete a
standardized assessment of his drinking, so we completed
a 1-month TLFB (Sobell & Sobell, 1995), the
DrInC (Miller et al., 1995), and a Decisional Balance
Sheet (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985; see Figure 13.2). Based
on this information, I provided him with a standardized
feedback sheet (Figure 13.5) about his drinking. The
sheet provided data about how his drinking compared
to national norms (Epstein & McCrady, 2009), as well
as information about his peak BAL, usual BAL, and
negative consequences of his drinking. Bill found the
feedback interesting and asked questions about alcohol
metabolism, epidemiological surveys, and alcohol and
health effects. Although his wife, Diana, was somewhat
impatient with this conversation, I thought that Bill’s
interest in learning more about alcohol and its effects
was a positive sign.

We discussed drinking goals, and I suggested the
Moderation Management (2006) drinking guideline
for men of no more than 14 drinks in a week, no more
than 4 days’ drinking per week, and no more than four
drinks per occasion. Bill indicated that he wanted to
continue with daily drinking, but with a limit of three
drinks per day. Diana was agreeable, saying that if he
kept to this limit she would be “thrilled.” Although
his selected goal was higher than I would have liked,
I agreed in order to engage him further in treatment.
I then gave him his first “homework” assignment—to
initiate self-recording of his drinking (see Figure 13.3).
The assignment of homework serves as a useful behavioral
probe for level of motivation, and I was pleased
when Bill returned to the next session with completed
self-recording cards.

Suzanne was a 39-year-old computer programmer
whom I treated in outpatient therapy as part of a treatment
research project. Suzanne drank daily, typically
consuming three glasses of wine per day. She had made
a number of unsuccessful attempts to stop drinking and
felt that she had completely lost control over her drinking
even though the amount she drank was not remarkably
high. She was concerned about her ability to be
alert and available to her children in the evenings when
she was drinking, particularly since her husband traveled
frequently for his business. Suzanne sought treatment
voluntarily and wanted to abstain from drinking
completely. Despite her self-referral to treatment and
her self-defined need for abstinence, Suzanne reacted
to the same structured feedback quite differently than
Bill did. She had provided information for the TLFB
and completed the Rutgers Consequences of Use Questionnaire
(RCU), but when I gave her feedback that
she had been drinking an average of 21.5 drinks per
week, she told me that this figure was too high and that
our measure was not very accurate. She also indicated
that she was participating in a research study, not in
therapy, which was why she thought it important that
we have accurate data. I did not argue with her perspective,
agreeing that she was in a research study, but
that I hoped that the study would helpful to her. She
continued with treatment, and several weeks later commented
spontaneously, “You know, I know that I’m in
treatment, and I really need it. I think I was just protecting
my ego at the beginning by focusing on the research
part so much.”

Anne, a 32-year-old, married college graduate
working as a cocktail waitress, was the mother of a
20-month-old daughter, Breanne. Her husband, Char


lie, was working full time and enrolled in a doctoral
program in mechanical engineering. She entered treatment
as part of our women’s treatment research program.
She was a daily drinker with a varying pattern of
consumption. During the evenings, when her husband
was at school, she drank one or two bottles of wine.
When he was home, her typical consumption was one
glass of wine with dinner. She also drank at the end of
her shift at work, consuming four to six beers on those
evenings. When I gave her the feedback about her alcohol
consumption, indicating that her level of consumption
placed her in the 99th percentile of women, her
eyes filled with tears and she looked visibly distraught,
saying repeatedly, “I knew it was bad, but I never knew
it was this bad.” As treatment progressed, Anne made
few changes in her drinking. She canceled or changed
appointments, and said on several occasions, “If I
didn’t like you, I’d probably just quit the whole thing.”
She continued:

anne: I really like to drink. When Charlie is at school,
I make myself a nice dinner—a lamb chop, a salad—
and have an excellent bottle of wine. No one bothers
me, and I enjoy myself. But I know I should stop because
of Breanne.

tHeraPist: [As part of the treatment protocol, we had
completed a decisional matrix, and I suggest that we
return to that form.] Anne, let’s look at your decisional
matrix again. We did this a few weeks ago.
When you look at it now, what strikes you?

anne: Everything on it is still true. I’m not being a
good mother with all this drinking. I’m out of it at
night, and I have no energy during the day. I just plop
her in front of the television, and she watches Dora
the Explorer. I keep thinking about when she gets
older, “Do I want her to have a drunken mother?”

tHeraPist: It seems as though those feelings are very
strong right now, but it’s hard for you to keep them
in the front of your mind each day. I wonder if you
could review this sheet every day at some point.
Would that help?

anne: I think so. I can look at it while Breanne is eating
her breakfast. My motivation would be sitting
right in front of me then. I’ll try that.

Anne began reviewing her decisional matrix every
day. The task seemed helpful for about a month, and
she began to decrease her drinking, joined a gym, and


Alcohol Use Disorders

came to treatment regularly. However, these changes
were short-lived, and she fairly quickly reverted to
her pattern of erratic treatment attendance and heavy
drinking.

Selection of Drinking Goals

The final major area to consider in treatment planning
is the selection of drinking goals. Traditional approaches
to alcoholism treatment view abstinence as
the only appropriate drinking goal because these approaches
view alcoholism as a progressive disease that
can only be arrested with abstinence. Behavioral clinicians
have examined alternatives to abstinence and
have developed a number of strategies to teach clients
how to drink moderately. Although better accepted as
a goal for individuals who are hazardous drinkers or
have a mild AUD, moderation training continues to be
controversial, and the clinician who elects to provide
such treatment may be vulnerable to criticism from
the traditional, mainstream alcoholism treatment community.
Earlier studies suggest that the long-term outcomes
of alcoholism include reduced drinking (e.g.,
Helzer et al., 1985; Vaillant, 1983), but early data about
the success of moderation training were more mixed.
Two European studies found that giving clients the
opportunity to select treatment goals increased compliance
with treatment and might improve treatment
outcome (Ojehegan & Berglund, 1989; Orford & Keddie,
1986). Two recent studies that have tested training
in moderate drinking using a Web-based intervention
(Hester, Delaney, Campbell, & Handmaker, 2009) or
a women’s therapy group (Walitzer & Connors, 2007)
both found positive outcomes for moderation training
with low dependence drinkers, with the results for the
women’s group sustained over 30 months of follow-up.
In the past, I have argued in favor of abstinence as a
preferred treatment goal (see, e.g., McCrady, 1992; Nathan
& McCrady, 1987), and continue to view it as the
preferred treatment goal for individuals with moderate
to severe AUDs. Abstinence is clearly defined and is in
accord with usual clinical practice in the United States.
Also, agreeing readily to a goal of moderate drinking
may reinforce a client’s view that alcohol is important
and necessary to his/her daily functioning.

Under certain circumstances the use of a reduced
drinking goal is appropriate. Moderation may be used
as a provisional goal to engage a client in treatment, or
it may be used when the client will not agree to abstinence
but does want assistance to change (as with Bill).

A moderate drinking goal also is more appropriate if a
client shows few signs of alcohol dependence or withdrawal,
has a history of being able to drink in moderation,
does not have medical or psychological problems
that would be exacerbated by continued drinking, is
younger, and does not have a family history of alcoholism
(Rosenberg, 1993). If clinician and client select a
moderation goal, a period of initial abstinence usually
makes it easier for the client to drink moderately. In selecting
a moderation goal, the clinician should be careful
to help the client recognize the current and potential
negative consequences of excessive drinking, and make
an informed and thoughtful choice in selecting a treatment
goal. The clinician should view any initial drinking
goal (abstinence or moderation) as tentative, to be
reevaluated as therapy progresses.

Initiating Abstinence

For the client with a goal of abstinence, the clinician
has a variety of alternatives to help him/her initiate
abstinence. With a client whose goal is moderation,
the most conservative approach is to initiate a period
of abstinence, then gradually reintroduce alcohol. As
noted earlier, several detoxification alternative strategies
are available, including inpatient detoxification,
ambulatory detoxification, “cold turkey” detoxification
(in which the client simply stops drinking abruptly), or
a graduated program of reduction of drinking over a
period of weeks, until the client reaches abstinence. A
case example illustrates a graduated program of reduction
of drinking.

Steve, a 48-year-old, homeless, unemployed man
with a long history of heroin, cocaine, and alcohol dependence,
entered treatment after heroin detoxification
but was still drinking an average of eight drinks per
day (usually a half-pint of hard liquor plus one to two
beers). He was healthy and had no history of alcohol
withdrawal symptoms. No inpatient detoxification facility
was available to him given his homeless and economically
destitute state. Initial treatment focused on
helping him achieve a stable housing situation and obtaining
temporary General Assistance (welfare). Following
these social interventions, the therapist (one of
our practicum students) began to focus on his drinking.
Steve expressed a strong preference for a program of
graduated reduction in drinking. He was evaluated by a
physician at the local free clinic and cleared medically.
We had him record his drinking for 1 week to establish
a clear baseline. We then set a program to reduce his


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

drinking by 15% per week, or eight drinks per week.
We discussed specific strategies to achieve this goal
each week, and Steve continued to monitor his drinking.
During the alcohol reduction period, Steve reestablished
contact with a former long-term girlfriend who
had terminated their relationship when he relapsed to
alcohol and heroin use. She had heard that he was off
heroin and expressed interest in being involved with
him again. Her presence provided a strong incentive for
him to follow the alcohol reduction program because
she was unaware that he had been drinking. The program
progressed smoothly, and he stopped drinking
after 7 weeks.

Developing a Functional Analysis

As described earlier, completing a behavioral assessment
of the factors associated with a client’s drinking
includes both a structured and a qualitative dimension,
and incorporates clinical interviewing, questionnaires,
and self-recording of drinking and drinking urges. Suzanne,
described briefly earlier, provides an excellent
illustration of the complexity and results of the behavioral
assessment process.

Suzanne came from a large Jewish family, many
members of whom made demands on her. She had three
daughters, ages 10, 8, and 4 years old. Her drinking had
increased 5 years prior to treatment after a car accident
that took the life of her fraternal twin brother. They
had gone out to a Bruce Springsteen concert together,
and her brother had had several drinks at the concert.
An autopsy after the accident revealed that he had also
been using cocaine, but Suzanne had been unaware of
his drug use. She blamed herself for allowing him to
drive and for not insisting that he stop when he began
to drive in a reckless manner. She began to drink immediately
after the accident and quickly established a
pattern of daily consumption of a half-bottle of wine
per day.

Although the amount was not that great, she reported
that the alcohol was very important because it helped
her avoid her overwhelming sadness about her brother’s
death, especially at the end of the day. The results of
the behavioral assessment revealed a more complex
pattern of drinking antecedents. On the DPQ, Suzanne
rated emotional antecedents as most important, endorsing
feelings of sadness, hurt, and frustration. She also
indicated that certain environments were triggers for
drinking, such as specific restaurants, times of the day
(evening), and activities (particularly watching televi


sion). Other major triggers emerged from Suzanne’s
self-recording cards—her interactions with extended
family members and with friends, and situations related
to her children. Her parents were highly critical
of how she was raising her children. Suzanne and her
husband, Josh, were attending a conservative temple,
kept kosher in their home, did not allow violent video
games, and expected each daughter to participate in a
fine arts activity (music, dance, or painting). Her parents
believed that their grandchildren’s upbringing and
Suzanne and Josh’s standards were too strict and conservative,
and they were vocal in their criticisms. Other
familial stressors included her interactions with a sister
who was getting divorced and a cousin who was in
economic straits. Each contacted Suzanne on a regular
basis, demanding either her attention or her money. Suzanne’s
functional analysis is provided in Figure 13.6.

Early Sobriety Strategies

Early sobriety strategies help the client maintain abstinence
from alcohol. Cognitive-behavioral techniques
vary with the individual but may include stimulus control
strategies to avoid or rearrange high-risk situations,
development of skills to deal with urges to drink, learning
to think differently about drinking and not drinking,
identification of behaviors alternative to drinking
in high-risk situations, developing alternative ways to
obtain the reinforcers previously obtained from alcohol,
and learning to refuse drinks.

Stimulus Control

Stimulus control strategies are designed to alter environmental
cues for drinking by avoiding the cue, rearranging
it, or implementing different responses in
the same environment. Stimulus control strategies are
compatible with the AA suggestion to be attuned to
“people, places, and things.” Work with Suzanne illustrates
stimulus control strategies.

With Suzanne, stimulus control strategies served a
major function early in treatment. She developed specific
strategies to deal with a number of the environmental
high-risk situations identified in her functional
analysis. Her first approach was to avoid such situations
whenever possible. She suggested to Josh that they eat
only at restaurants without liquor licenses, and asked
that they decline several social invitations to places
where alcohol would be the main focus of the evening
(e.g., cocktail parties). The one situation that she could

not avoid was the end of the day, after the children had
gone to bed. Her usual routine had been to complete
the dinner dishes while Josh helped the girls get ready
for bed, then to sit down in the den with her wine and
the television after reading the children a story. She
decided that she needed to disrupt this pattern and
thought that if she got ready for bed herself, then curled
up on the couch with a book and a cup of herbal tea, she
would experience less urge to drink. It took her 3 weeks
to get to a bookstore to buy some light novels, but once
she had the books, Suzanne was able to implement this
plan with success, except when she was upset.

Dealing with Urges

As individuals decrease their drinking or initiate abstinence,
they may experience urges or cravings for alcohol.
It is helpful to provide the client with a framework
for understanding that urges are learned responses to
drinking situations, and that urges abate if unfulfilled.
Marlatt and Gordon (1985) suggested the use of imagery
to help clients cope with urges, and described
either acceptance-oriented imagery (e.g., surfing with
the urge) or action-oriented imagery (e.g., attacking the
urge with a samurai sword).

Suzanne struggled with urges to drink, particularly
when anything reminded her of her twin brother’s
death. During therapy, we focused on a variety of aspects
of her feelings about her brother’s death and also
addressed the urges more directly. Suzanne initially
reacted to the imagery techniques negatively, saying
that she was not a person who imagined things much.
She clearly needed some way to cope with these rather
strong urges, so I pushed her a bit to try:

tHeraPist: I appreciate that you don’t think of yourself
as imaginative, but maybe I can help you out.
Just humor me for a minute, and let’s see if we can
come up with an image that grabs you. It doesn’t
matter what the image is—you could imagine climbing
a mountain and coming down the other side, or
spraying the urge with a fire extinguisher.

suzanne: (smiling) I know what I can imagine—I

could picture you jumping out of the bottle and shak


ing your head at me.

tHeraPist: OK. Should I look mean?

suzanne: No, just having you there would help me
deal with it.

tHeraPist: All right, I can live with that.

suzanne: In fact, I could picture a row of wine

bottles—with you coming out of the first one, then

showing me all the disgusting things in the other one.

tHeraPist: So what would be disgusting? Ticks?

suzanne: Ticks would be good, and maybe cockroaches,
too.

tHeraPist: Let’s try this out.

At that point, I had her practice using the imagery in
an imagined urge situation. Remarkably, she used the
imagery frequently and found it helpful.

A second technique for coping with urges is to enlist
the assistance of a family member or friend. Persons
involved with AA are told to call someone in the AA
program when they feel the urge to drink, and they usually
receive telephone numbers from several members.
Clients not involved with AA can seek other sources of
support. Suzanne, for example, asked her husband to
help her when she had the urge to drink. She asked Josh
to remind her of why she had stopped drinking and to
say, “Of course, it has to be your decision.”

Addressing Cognitive Distortions about Alcohol

People who drink heavily hold stronger positive expectancies
about the effects of alcohol than do people
who drink more lightly (Pabst, Baumeister, & Kraus,
2010). Clients may believe that drinking facilitates social
interactions, enhances sexual responsiveness, allows
them to forget painful events or feelings, or makes
them more capable. These beliefs often are deeply held
and difficult to challenge, particularly if a client continues
to drink. Several cognitive strategies may help.
First, effecting a period of abstinence allows the client
to experience many situations without alcohol—an
experience that often leads to reevaluation, with little
input from the therapist. At some point, many clients
are impressed with the vacuous nature of drunken
conversation; the undesirable physical appearance,
behaviors, and odors that accompany high BALs; and
the shallow nature of drinking relationships. The wise
therapist watches carefully for these observations and
underscores their importance and self-relevance. If a
client does not have such experiences spontaneously,
the therapist facilitates new views of drunken comportment
by developing a relatively safe way for the client
to observe intoxicated behavior—through either mov



Alcohol Use Disorders

ies or videotapes, or visits to a local bar (accompanied
by someone who is aware of and supports the client’s
abstinence).

A second strategy reported in the self-change literature
(Ludwig, 1985) is the ability to think past anticipated
positive benefits of drinking to the clear, though
often delayed, negative consequences of drinking. The
therapist and client can generate a list of negative consequences
of drinking and use imaginal rehearsal in
the session to help the client pair positive thoughts with
the list of negatives. Continued rehearsal in the natural
environment is then important. Third, some clients
develop a set of erroneous beliefs about their drinking
that set them up for drinking. Common beliefs include
“I’ve been doing so well, I can just drink tonight,” or
“I’ll have just one.” Although moderate drinking is possible
for some clients, others have histories of drinking
until they lose control, which is in direct opposition to
a belief in control, and they need to learn to counter
these beliefs.

Work with Steve provides a simple illustration of
cognitive strategies to address positive expectations
about drinking. Steve had a long history of loss-ofcontrol
drinking. After a period of abstinence, he began
to think, “I could have just one beer, and that would
be fine.” His therapist questioned the accuracy of that
belief. Steve readily acknowledged that he had never
been able to control his drinking in the past, that if his
girlfriend found out she’d be very upset and probably
leave him, and that relapses to heavy drinking usually
led him to use heroin. Steve and his therapist developed
a simple cognitive formula to use when he thought
about drinking: “1 = 32 = 10,” meaning that for him,
one drink would lead to a quart of liquor (32 ounces),
which would lead to heroin use (10 bags a day).

Alternative/Distracting Behaviors

Drinking is a time-occupying activity, and clients may
see few alternatives to help them through times when
they previously would drink. Discussion of specific
behavioral alternatives to drinking that are both timeoccupying
and mentally or physically absorbing is another
helpful strategy early in treatment.

Steve’s experiences provide a particularly powerful
example of the alternatives that highly motivated clients
may find. After Steve found a room in a rooming house
and had begun the detoxification process, he was faced
with the daunting prospect of filling his completely un


structured days. Some of his time was occupied with
the time-consuming work of being poor—getting back
and forth to the soup kitchen, waiting at the free clinic
for medical services, getting an appropriate identification
card so that he was eligible for other charitable
programs, such as clothing distribution. But even with
these necessary activities, Steve had hours and hours
of free time. Steve began to address this challenge by
creating his own activities. He obtained a library card
and scheduled times for himself at the library. Instead
of reading randomly or recreationally, he decided to
read about the Crusades, which sparked an interest for
him in medieval Christianity. A lapsed Catholic, he decided
to attend Mass again, and began to attend daily.
His daily attendance led to involvement in a Bible study
group, and he became a thoughtful and passionate participant.
A creative man, Steve then began to write
short stories with religious themes.

Identifying Alternative Ways to Obtain Reinforcers

Among the more compelling aspects of alcohol and
drug use are the psychoactive properties of the substances.
In the short term, large quantities of alcohol
effectively deaden negative affect, decrease obsessional
thoughts, and decrease muscle tension, although these
effects do not endure over the long term. Alcoholic beverages
also have distinctive and desirable tastes that are
difficult to replace with other beverages. An important
aspect of the functional analysis is articulating the client’s
perception of positive consequences of drinking.
The clinician can address the power of these perceived
reinforcers in several ways: helping the client develop
alternative means of obtaining the same types of positive
experiences; challenging the client’s belief that the
desirable consequences will occur (e.g., questioning
whether the client is in fact more socially adept and appealing
after consuming a quart of vodka); helping the
client reevaluate the importance of these reinforcers;
and/or helping the client identify other classes of reinforcers
that might be valued more highly in the long run
(e.g., valuing spirituality more highly than hedonism).

Drink Refusal Skills

Some drinkers find the interpersonal aspects of abstinence
difficult. For them, identification of interpersonal
situations as high risk for drinking, development of effective
responses, and rehearsal of these responses all


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

form an important component of treatment. Early research
(Chaney, O’Leary, & Marlatt, 1978) suggested
that giving a quick response is strongly associated with
successful change. More recent research has found that
drink refusal training makes a unique positive contribution
to treatment outcome (Witkiewitz, Donovan,
& Hartzler, 2012). Suggested components of effective
drinks refusal include indicating clearly that the one
does not want an alcoholic beverage, requesting an
alternative beverage, communicating confidence and
comfort with the request, and being persistent in the
face of social pressure (Foy, Miller, Eisler, & O’Toole,
1976). In addition, clients who face excessive social
pressure may be advised to consider avoiding certain
social situations or persons.

Although the guidelines for refusing drinks appear
simple, client beliefs and expectations often make the
drink refusal process difficult. Common cognitions include
“Everyone will think I’m an alcoholic,” “My host
will be offended if I don’t drink,” or “People will think
I’m too good for them if I don’t drink.” As with other
distorted beliefs, the clinician can provide alternative
frameworks for thinking about drink refusal situations,
suggesting that most people really are uninterested in
others’ drinking, or that hosts are most concerned that
guests are enjoying themselves. Many clients also experience
ambivalence about not drinking and find that
the most difficult part of the drink refusal process is
internal rather than interpersonal. Another complicated
aspect of drink refusal is how much personal information
the client wishes to divulge. Most people share different
levels of personal information, depending on the
closeness of the relationship and their knowledge of the
other person’s behavior and attitudes. For persons to
whom a client does not want to disclose his/her drinking
problem, we encourage use of a simple “No, thank
you,” or, if pressed, a simple response that would discourage
pushing without being revealing, such as “I’m
watching my weight and can’t afford the calories,” “I’m
on medication that doesn’t allow me to drink,” or “My
stomach’s been acting up—I better pass.” None of these
replies protects the client against future offers, but each
is effective in the moment. For closer relationships, the
client makes a decision about when, where, and how
much to reveal. Two clinical examples illustrate these
points.

Steve was living in a boarding house and had friendly,
sociable neighbors who liked to drink on the front
porch. These neighbors were from the Portuguese
Azores and spoke virtually no English. After accepting

a beer from them one day, he insisted to his therapist
that he could not refuse because he did not speak Portuguese.
The therapist suggested that perhaps the word
“No,” spoken with a smile and a hand gesture, might
be understood even in Portuguese. Steve acknowledged
that his difficulty with refusing the drink came from
his desire to drink, and that a friendly “No” would certainly
work.

Suzanne did not want anyone to know that she had
a drinking problem, or that she was abstaining. This
stance posed problems for an upcoming cocktail party.
Strategizing, Suzanne decided ahead of time that she
would drink seltzer water that evening, and that she
would attempt to forestall offers of drinks by keeping
a glass of seltzer in her hand at all times. If offered
a drink, she decided to tell people that she had had
some health problems that might be made worse by her
drinking, so she was sticking to seltzer. Although she
was concerned that one of her friends (a social worker)
might surmise that she had an alcohol problem, the evening
progressed uneventfully.

Coping Strategies

Clients face challenges beyond those directly related
to their drinking. As do clients without drinking problems,
clients with such problems face common life
difficulties stemming from dysfunctional thoughts,
negative affect, and interpersonal conflicts. As clients
develop a greater ability to maintain abstinence or
moderated drinking, the clinician may devote increasing
attention to other problems clients are facing. Clinical
techniques to deal with dysfunctional thoughts or
social skills deficits can be used readily with clients
with drinking problems.

Dealing with Negative Affect

There are multiple sources of negative affect in persons
with alcohol abuse or dependence. As noted earlier in
the chapter, comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders
is high (e.g., mood and anxiety disorders are quite
common). Rates of sexual and physical abuse are also
elevated among those with AUDs (Cisler et al., 2011),
and the sequelae of these problems often include a
strongly negative affective component. In addition,
persons who have used alcohol to cope with negative
affect over an extended period of time may simply have
limited experience, and limited skills, to cope with the
pain that is a part of everyday life.


Alcohol Use Disorders

In focusing on negative affect, a careful assessment
of the causes is essential. Intense negative affect associated
with another disorder should be treated in accord
with the appropriate approach for that disorder. Dealing
with negative affect that is not necessarily disorderbased
presents different challenges. Full behavioral
mood management programs (e.g., Monti et al., 1990)
have been developed, although a description of these is
beyond the scope of the chapter. However, certain common
principles are of value. When clients first reduce
or stop drinking, they may experience all emotions as
unfamiliar and intense. Cognitive reframing to help clients
view these intense emotions as a natural part of
the change process may be useful. For clients pursuing
a moderation goal, avoidance of drinking at times
of intense negative affect provides the opportunity to
learn alternative coping strategies. Coping strategies
may vary with the type of negative emotion, and may
include relaxation, prayer or meditation; increasing the
experience of pleasurable events to decrease depression;
or use of anger management and assertiveness
skills to cope with angry feelings.

Work with Suzanne illustrates several of these principles.
Most difficult for Suzanne were any situations
that reminded her of the death of her twin. Their birthday,
the anniversary of his death, the celebration of
Father’s and Mother’s Days, holiday celebrations, and
special celebratory events for her children in which he
would have been importantly involved with (e.g., a bat
mitzvah) all elicited intense negative affect and a strong
desire to drink. Given that Suzanne had begun drinking
heavily right after her twin’s death, she had spent little
time experiencing grief or even discussing his death
and her feelings about it. My initial approach in therapy
was to give her opportunities to be exposed to these
negative feelings by simply talking about him in the
therapy session. The second approach was to discuss
and identify ways to approach events that reminded her
of him. I saw her over a 6-month period, during which
a number of these situations arose naturally. For example,
in the week prior to the anniversary of his death,
we discussed ways that she could focus on his death
and memories. Suzanne took one of her children to his
gravesite, and they cleaned it up and planted flowers together.
On the Saturday of the anniversary of his death,
she went to temple with her family, and then cooked
what had been her twin’s favorite dinner. The day was
sorrowful and Suzanne cried several times, but it was
the first anniversary that she felt she had honored him
rather than shaming his memory by getting drunk. We

also addressed her repetitive, self-blaming thoughts
about his death by using cognitive restructuring techniques.
She found it difficult not to blame herself for
his death, and few cognitive strategies had much impact
on the self-blame. Suzanne finally was able to begin to
think, “I cannot torture myself forever with this blame.
If I don’t let go of it, I won’t be a good mother. He’d be
disappointed with me if I let my children down.”

Lifestyle Balance and Pleasurable Activities

Marlatt and Donovan (2005) suggest that long-term
success is supported by lifestyle changes that enhance
positive experiences and allow for a balance between
responsibilities and pleasure. Although some studies
of successful self-changers (e.g., Vaillant & Milofsky,
1982) have revealed that development of an “alternative
dependency” (e.g., obsessive involvement with
work or exercise) is associated with successful longterm
abstinence, we typically work toward a more
balanced approach. As they begin to change, some of
our clients believe that they need to make up for their
previous lack of responsibility with a very high level
of responsibility to family, job, and home. Taking on
major redecorating or remodeling projects, trying to
spend every free moment with their children, or cleaning
out 10 years’ worth of messy drawers and cabinets
is not uncommon. This zeal for responsibility can be a
double-edged sword for both client and family. Unrelenting
attention to responsibilities may be simultaneously
satisfying and exhausting and unrewarding, and
may lead the client to question the value of not drinking.
Family members may be thrilled that the client is
taking on responsibility but leery of the stability of the
change and unwilling to give up responsibilities they
have assumed for him/her. They also may experience
the client’s enthusiasm as an intrusion on their own
independent lives and schedules. Clients should be
prepared for such reactions, and the clinician can help
reframe the family’s response as understandable. With
most clients, it is important for the clinician to suggest
the importance of leisure time, pleasurable activities,
and self-reinforcement for positive changes made.

Helping Suzanne identify a half-hour per day during
which she could relax, read, or exercise was a challenge.
She believed that she should devote herself to
her daughters—a belief that resulted in her being with
them virtually all the time when they were home.
When they were at school, she focused on housecleaning,
cooking, errands, paying bills, and other chores.


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

She was exhausted and tense at the end of the day, and
commented that alcohol had been a good way to “come
down.” We finally agreed on a half-hour block before
lunch, during which she would use her exercise bike,
read a book of daily meditations, or take a walk. She
was only partially successful in these efforts, often citing
other responsibilities that took precedence.

Partner/Family Involvement and the Social
Context of Treatment

The literature on the treatment of alcohol use disorders
suggests that the involvement of some significant social
system is associated with positive treatment results
(reviewed in McCrady et al., 2013). Because of these
findings, the clinician’s first inclination should be to
involve the client’s spouse/partner or some significant
other in the treatment. There are a number of ways to
involve significant others: using them as sources of information,
having them provide differential reinforcement
for drinking and abstinence, helping them to provide
emotional or practical support, involving them in
relationship-focused treatment, providing treatment to
them without the person who drinks, and/or helping
them access new social systems.

Information

Folklore suggests that persons with alcoholism minimize
or lie about their drinking and its consequences.
The empirical literature suggests that such individuals
provide relatively accurate data when sober, and when
there are no strong negative consequences for telling
the truth (e.g., Sobell & Sobell, 2003). Despite these
results, a number of clinical considerations suggest that
obtaining information from a family member may be
useful in the assessment phase of treatment.

Clients who are referred to or coerced into treatment
may be reluctant to provide full information about their
drinking. Collecting data from the referring agent helps
both client and clinician understand the reasons for the
referral. Even with self-referred clients, significant others
can provide information that may be unavailable to
the clients because of problems with memory or recall.
In addition, an intimate significant other usually has
observed the drinker over a long period of time and in
multiple environments, and may have valuable observations
to contribute to the conceptualization of antecedents
to drinking.

Responses to Drinking and Abstinence

A different type of social system involvement is the
establishment of a network that provides differential
reinforcement for abstinence and applies negative consequences
for drinking. Such reinforcement may be
relatively simple, such as positive comments and encouragement
from friends and family, or it can involve
the negotiation of detailed contracts that specify the
consequences of drinking and abstinence. The “community
reinforcement approach” (CRA; Meyers &
Smith, 1995) helps clients access potential reinforcers
(jobs, families, social clubs), teaches clients and partners
behavioral coping skills, and may involve development
of contingency contracts to make access to reinforcers
contingent on sobriety. In addition, clients may
be prescribed disulfiram or naltrexone, and compliance
may be monitored by a significant other. Evaluations
of the CRA approach suggest that clients are significantly
more successful than controls in maintaining
abstinence and employment, avoiding hospitalizations
or jail, and maintaining a stable residence. In addition
to formal treatments that focus on manipulation
of environmental contingencies, the therapist also may
teach spouses/partners and other family members how
to allow the client to experience the naturally occurring
negative consequences of drinking. Many spouses/
partners protect the drinker from these consequences
by covering for him/her at work, doing his/her chores,
or lying to friends and family about the drinking (e.g.,
Orford et al., 2005). Experience of these negative consequences
may increase the client’s awareness of the
extent and severity of his/her drinking problem, and
provide further motivation for change.

Decreasing Cues for Drinking

Significant others also may engage in behaviors that
cue further drinking. A wife who wants her husband to
stop drinking may nag him repeatedly about the problems
his drinking is causing, hoping that her concerns
will motivate him to change. Or a husband may try to
get his wife to stop drinking by limiting her access to
alcohol or tightly controlling their money. Such behaviors
may have an unintended and negative effect,
eliciting anger or defensiveness from the person with
the drinking problem, and leading to further drinking.
Helping spouses/partners learn to identify such behaviors,
recognize the results of these actions, and find al



Alcohol Use Disorders

ternative ways to discuss concerns about drinking may
be helpful.

Support for Abstinence

Significant others can provide many kinds of support to
clients. Support may involve helping a client to implement
behavior change, discussing urges to drink, supporting
a client’s plan to avoid high-risk situations for
drinking, or (upon the request of the client) assisting in
the implementation of other coping skills that support
sobriety.

Relationship Change

For many clients, interactions with their spouses/partners,
children, parents, or close friends cue drinking.
Thus, treatment that focuses on changing these interpersonal
relationships is another way that significant
others may become involved. These interventions
may include couple or family therapy, or parent skills
training. Data (McCrady et al., 2009; McCrady, Stout,
Noel, Abrams, & Nelson, 1991) suggest that a focus on
changing the couple relationship during conjoint alcoholism
treatment results in greater stability of drinking
outcomes, fewer separations, and greater couple satisfaction.


Accessing New Social Systems

Some clients have either no social support system or one
that strongly supports heavy drinking. For such clients,
it is important to access new systems that either reinforce
abstinence or are incompatible with heavy drinking.
Self-help groups are one potential source of such
support. Because many religious groups are against the
use of alcohol, serious involvement in such a group also
may support abstinence. Many group activities are incompatible
with drinking: Running, hiking, or cycling
groups are examples. Unfortunately, alcohol can be involved
in almost any activity, and therapist and client
need to look carefully at activity groups to determine
whether the group norm includes drinking.

In summary, decisions about the social context of alcoholism
treatment are complicated. The initial assessment
should involve at least one significant other. The
results of the assessment should reveal persons who are
most available for treatment, and who might be sources
of support and reinforcement. For some clients with no

readily accessible supports, new support systems need
to be developed.

Long‑Term Maintenance

Relapse Prevention

Marlatt and Gordon’s (1985) RP model and Witkiewitz
and Marlatt’s (2004) revised RP model are comprehensive
treatment models; Epstein and McCrady’s (2009)
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) manual provides
specific RP exercises in the last several treatment sessions.
Many elements of the RP treatment model already
have been described—identifying high-risk situations
for drinking, developing alternative strategies to
cope with high-risk situations, enhancing self-efficacy
for coping, dealing with positive expectancies about
the use of alcohol, and facilitating the development of
a balanced lifestyle. An additional and important part
of the RP model is addressing the possibility of relapse,
and developing preventive and responsive strategies related
to relapse.

Clients are told that use of alcohol after treatment is
not uncommon, and treatment addresses this possibility.
Two basic strategies are used. First, a client is helped
to develop a list of signs of an impending relapse, including
behavioral, cognitive, interpersonal, and affective
signs. If a client’s spouse/partner is part of the
treatment, he/she contributes to the list. After this list
is developed, a set of possible responses, should these
signs arise, is developed. Most important is for the client
to recognize that these warning signs should trigger
action rather than inaction and fatalistic cognitions
about the inevitability of relapse. A second set of strategies
involves response to drinking or heavy drinking.
The clinician attempts to address the possibility of the
AVE by calling attention to the possibility that a client
may have catastrophic thoughts if he/she drinks and
helping him/her rehearse alternative thoughts. Marlatt
and Gordon (1985) also suggested a series of behavioral
steps: Introduce a behavioral delay (1–2 hours) between
an initial drink and any subsequent drinks; get out of
the immediate drinking situation; conduct a functional
analysis of the drinking situation during that time; review
possible negative consequences of drinking; and
call someone who might be helpful. Some research
evidence supports the use of such RP approaches. For
example, we found in our own research (McCrady, Epstein,
& Hirsch, 1999) that including RP procedures as


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

part of conjoint alcoholism treatment was successful
in reducing the length of relapse episodes compared
to conjoint CBT without RP. O’Farrell, Choquette, and
Cutter (1998), who incorporated RP techniques into
their couple therapy treatment by providing additional
therapy sessions over the 12 months after initial treatment,
reported less frequent drinking among couples
who received the additional therapy.

Maintaining Contact with Clients

Time-limited treatment is appropriate and effective for
many clients, and there is good evidence of long-term,
sustained improvement following a course of outpatient
treatment (Project MATCH Research Group, 1998).
However, periods of relapse are common. The clinical
strategies I have described for RP are intended to minimize
periods of problem use and to maximize positive
outcomes. For some clients, however, alcohol dependence
must be viewed as chronic, relapsing disorder
(McLellan et al., 2000). As with other chronic health
problems, such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis,
acute care models that treat individuals and send them
on their way may be inappropriate and ineffective. An
alternative strategy provides longer-term, low-intensity
contact over an extended time interval (McKay et al.,
2011).

During the initial treatment of a client with a history
of severe alcohol dependence, multiple treatment
episodes, and difficulty maintaining successful change,
the clinician may elect to set a different expectancy
with that client—that some form of contact will be ongoing
and long-term.

Lee, a 54-year-old married man, came to treatment
with problems with alcohol dependence and agoraphobia.
Treatment focused on both disorders, and he was
successful in becoming abstinent from alcohol and in
gradually increasing the distances that he could drive
by himself. Lee’s home was an hour’s drive from my
office, and treatment had gone on for almost 12 months
before he could drive to my office without his wife
accompanying him. By the end of the year, we were
meeting every 2 to 3 weeks. Given that Lee had been
abstinent for a year and was functioning well, we discussed
the possibility of termination. His response was
instructive:

lee: Doctor, I’ve been drinking a long, long time. One

year is just a drop in the bucket in comparison. I

think that I need to keep seeing you.

tHeraPist: Lee, I understand your concerns, but
you’ve been doing well for quite a long time now.
Maybe we should just cut down more on how often
you come in. How about an appointment in a month,
and making it a bit shorter—a half-hour instead of
an hour?

lee: I think that’s a good idea. Let’s try it.

I gradually tapered the frequency and length of my
sessions with Lee, and saw him twice per year, 15
minutes per session, for the last 3½ years of his 5-year
course of treatment. He described the importance of
the sessions: “I just know I’ll have to see you and tell
you what I’ve been doing. It keeps me honest.”

Management of Complicating Conditions

As I described earlier in the chapter, clients with
AUDs may present with myriad other complicating
conditions. The clinician must assess and develop a
treatment plan for the multiple needs of such clients.
At a minimum, clinicians should consider possible
problems related to housing, transportation, income,
occupation/employment, the legal system, the family,
child care, medical conditions, and comorbid psychological
disorders. Knowledge of services and agencies
in the local community and the development of working
relationships with a range of agencies are essential
to the treatment of complicated clients. Rose, Zweben,
Ockert, and Baier (2013) provide a comprehensive
framework for interfacing with other health and social
systems.

The Role of Self‑Help Groups

Types of self-help groups were described in an earlier
section of this chapter. Various therapeutic strategies
may facilitate involvement in a self-help group, when
appropriate. The clinician should first assess whether
a client may be a good candidate for self-help group
involvement. Clients with very high social anxiety or
social phobia, clients who believe that a person should
take care of problems alone, and those with a history
of negative experiences with self-help groups may be
poorer candidates. Conversely, affiliative clients, those
who are used to solving problems with assistance from
others, those who are particularly anxious and concerned
about their drinking, those whose social support
systems strongly support continued heavy drink



Alcohol Use Disorders

ing, and those with more severe alcohol dependence are
particularly good candidates for AA. Persons who are
interested in the social support aspects of self-help but
explicitly reject some of the constructs associated with
AA (e.g., powerlessness or spirituality) may be best
served by referral to an alternative self-help group.

As with all aspects of the therapy, the clinician should
use a client-centered approach to the introduction of
AA or other self-help groups. Such an approach suggests
a dialogue between client and therapist, acknowledgment
and discussion of the client’s perceptions and
concerns, and development of a mutually agreed-upon
plan. Because many clients have misconceptions about
AA and are unfamiliar with some of the alternative
organizations, the clinician should be prepared to describe
the organizations and answer questions. It also
is helpful for the clinician to have some basic publications
from each group available in the office. At times,
I may encourage a reluctant client to try a few meetings
to sample firsthand what actually occurs. We negotiate
a very short-term agreement for a specified number of
meetings in a specified length of time (e.g., six meetings
in 3 weeks); we agree that if the client continues to
be negative or reluctant after trying the groups, then we
will abandon this idea; and we discuss the client’s experiences
and perceptions of the self-help group meeting
in each therapy session. I use behavioral sampling with
other aspects of therapy as well: Clients often cannot
visualize how a strategy might work without trying it—
be it a relaxation technique, an AA meeting, or an assertive
response—and I encourage clients to be open to
new strategies. In AA, newcomers may be told, “Your
best thinking got you here,” which suggests that their
own coping strategies have been ineffective. Behavioral
sampling is based on this same construct.

Therapist Variables

As with any form of therapy, the therapist’s relationship
and the therapeutic stance he/she assumes with
the client are important. Empathy, active listening,
instillation of hope, flexible application of therapeutic
principles and techniques, and establishment of a sense
that therapist and client are working toward mutually
agreed-upon goals are essential. Research suggests
that in contrast to a confrontational style, an empathic,
motivational style is associated with better treatment
outcomes, and that confrontational behaviors by the
therapist tend to elicit defensive and counteraggressive
behaviors by the client (Miller, Benefield, & Tonigan,

1993; Miller & Rollnick, 2002). Such responses are
hardly conducive to a constructive therapeutic alliance.

Working with a client with an AUD often is difficult
because of both the client’s behavior during treatment
and his/her history of drinking-related behaviors that
the therapist may find repugnant or upsetting. The client
may lie about or minimize drinking during treatment.
If the spouse/partner is also involved in the treatment,
the therapeutic relationship becomes even more
complicated.

By treating a client with a drinking problem along
with a spouse/partner who wants that client to stop or
decrease drinking, the therapist is allied de facto with
the spouse/partner. The partner may attempt to enhance
his/her alliance with the therapist by echoing the
therapist’s comments, expressing anger at the client’s
behavior, being confrontational, or, alternatively, being
submissive and allowing the client to be verbally aggressive
or dominant.

Certain therapist attitudes and behaviors appear to
be conducive to successful treatment. First is a sense
of empathy with the client. The therapist must develop
some understanding of the client’s subjective experience
of entering therapy and the difficulty of admitting
behaviors that are personally embarrassing and often
not socially sanctioned. In addition, the therapist needs
to have some appreciation of the incredible difficulties
involved with long-term change in drinking behavior.
He/she may develop this appreciation by attempting to
change his/her own deeply ingrained behavior pattern
by attending meetings of some self-help group (e.g.,
AA, SMART Recovery) and listening carefully to clients.


A second important therapist skill is the ability
to distinguish between the person and the drinkingrelated
behavior. The client needs to be able to describe
drinking-related actions without feeling either that the
therapist is repulsed or that the therapist condones or
accepts such behaviors. This is a delicate balance to
achieve, especially when a client describes drinking
episodes in a joking manner that may hide embarrassment
or disgust with the behavior. The client’s motivation
to change may be enhanced by discussing negative,
drinking-related behaviors and experiencing the negative
affect associated with thinking about those actions.
The therapist also should communicate a sense of hope
to the client by anticipating positive changes that might
be associated with changes in drinking, and by emphasizing
that it is possible to change. Thus, the implied
message to the client is as follows:


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

“You have done many things when drinking that are
distressing to you and to the people around you. The
fact that you are in treatment is a statement that you
want to change. It is important to talk about things
you have done when drinking because being aware
of them will strengthen your desire to stop drinking
and to stop doing these things. Making changes
will take time and a lot of work on your part, but I
believe that you will be successful if you stick with
treatment.”

In other words, the therapist’s message is positive
about change, but negative about drinking-related behavior.


A third important therapist quality is integrity. Both
because of their discomfort and their reinforcement
history, it is difficult for some clients to honestly report
their drinking episodes, failed homework assignments,
or their feelings and attitudes about being in treatment.
The therapist can acknowledge how difficult it
is to be honest given that lying was probably adaptive
in the past, but he/she must make it clear that part of
therapy involves learning how to be honest. The therapist
also must provide a positive model of integrity.
He/she should not ignore the smell of alcohol on a client’s
breath, and he/she should review the homework
assigned each week. Attending to the client’s behavior
teaches the client the importance of following through
on commitments and increases the chances that therapist
and client will be able to identify problems and
blocks to progress in treatment.

The therapist also must set clear expectations about
both the client’s and his/her own responsibilities to the
therapy, and must be able to set appropriate limits. The
therapist should set clear expectations for the client:
coming to scheduled sessions on time, calling if unable
to attend, paying the bill for therapy, coming in sober,
and completing assigned homework. The therapist also
should make his/her own commitment to therapy clear,
by being at sessions on time, being reasonably available
by telephone, providing coverage when away, and providing
treatments with demonstrated empirical support
for their effectiveness. Being clear about expectations
for the client’s behavior during therapy emphasizes the
therapist’s commitment to therapy as a serious process.

Client Variables

Only a few client characteristics are consistent predictors
of treatment outcome (Haaga, McCrady, & Lebow,

2006). Clients who have positive expectancies about
the outcomes of treatment tend to have better outcomes.
Additionally, clients with greater readiness to change
have more positive outcomes. Finally, clients with more
severe problems have poorer outcomes. Both treatment
expectancies and readiness to change can be influenced
by the therapist.

The clinician must be aware of and sensitive to a
number of issues that persons with drinking problems
bring to treatment. The client’s emotional experience,
his/her beliefs, attitudes, and physical state (described
in the section on treatment settings), and the social context
of drinking (described in the section on the social
context of drinking) are all important aspects of the
therapeutic plan.

A person has a variety of reactions to the initial realization
that his/her drinking is causing problems. Most
commonly, as negative consequences accumulate, an
individual begins to feel out of control and ashamed
of the behavior. The person’s actions may be unacceptable
to his/her self-definition. Thus, financial or work
irresponsibility, neglecting family members, engaging
in physical violence, or verbal abuse all may be
actions about which the individual feels intense guilt
and self-blame. The prospect of admitting these actions
to a stranger is frightening and embarrassing, making
it difficult for a client to discuss drinking-associated
problems. Because many clients ascribe their problems
to weakness or lack of willpower, and believe that if
they were only “stronger” these events would not occur,
they blame themselves. Thus, clients are unusually
sensitive to implied criticisms from the therapist. The
therapist can attenuate this difficulty by making empathic
comments while asking questions, letting clients
know that their actions are common among people who
drink heavily, and listening to clients’ descriptions of
drinking-related actions in an accepting manner. Clients
also hold a number of beliefs and attitudes about
alcohol and their ability to change that make change
difficult. People with AUDs have positive expectancies
about the effects of alcohol on feelings and behavior,
and they hold these more strongly than do people without
drinking problems. They may attribute their drinking
to reasons external to themselves and believe that
they are not personally responsible for either drinking
or changing. They may have low self-efficacy beliefs
about their ability to change their drinking or to handle
alcohol-related situations without drinking, or they
may have unrealistically high self-efficacy beliefs that
are not grounded in actuality. Finally, if people stop


Alcohol Use Disorders

drinking and then consume alcohol again, cognitive
dissonance may occur; they may experience the AVE
(Marlatt & Gordon, 1985), characterized by an excessively
negative reaction to initial alcohol consumption,
and a self-perception that they have “blown” their abstinence
and will inevitably relapse to the previous drinking
pattern.

case stuDy

In the preceding sections, I have presented case examples
to illustrate the application of parts of our treatment
model. In this section, I present a complete outpatient
therapy case to illustrate a number of the issues
described earlier in the context of ongoing treatment.
The couple was part of a research project evaluating
different approaches to the maintenance of change following
conjoint behavioral alcoholism treatment (Mc-
Crady et al., 1999).

Couples in the study had to have been married or
cohabitating for at least 6 months; neither partner could
have a primary problem with the use of illicit drugs or
show evidence of gross cognitive impairment or psychosis;
and only the male partner could show evidence
of alcohol abuse or dependence. All couples were seen
by a therapist for 15–17 sessions of weekly outpatient
treatment, and agreed to a baseline assessment and 18
months of posttreatment follow-up.

Carl and Maria were married, and both were 32 years
old. They came to treatment because of Carl’s drinking.
Maria was of average height, had long, black, wavy hair
and was heavy. Carl was also of average height, had
blond hair, and was slim but showed the beginnings of a
“beer belly.” Both were neat and attractive. The couple
had been married 5 years and had known each other for
12 years. They had two boys, ages 2 and 3. Both came
from intact families, although Carl’s father had died a
number of years previously. Carl’s family was primarily
Polish; Maria’s was Italian.

At the time of treatment, Carl and Maria had been
separated for 5 months. He was living with his mother
in her home; Maria was renting a one-bedroom apartment
in a poor community, where she lived with the
two boys. Maria was a trained cosmetologist; Carl was
an electrician who worked out of the union hall. Carl
was not working at the time because he did not want to
establish a pattern of support for Maria or the children
in case she filed for divorce. In addition, if he did not
work for a certain period of time, Carl would be able to

withdraw his money from the union’s pension plan, and
he thought that would be an easy way to obtain money.
Maria was not working because she had decided that
Carl would have to babysit while she worked, and she
did not think that he would be reliable about coming
to her apartment to care for the children. She was supported
by Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC); Carl worked odd jobs “under the table.” Both
were high school graduates.

The couple came to treatment at Maria’s urging. She
was very concerned about Carl’s drinking and cited it
as the primary reason for their marital separation.

Behavioral Assessment
and Case Conceptualization

Carl and Maria were assessed using several approaches.
Their assessment was somewhat more extensive than is
usual in clinical practice because of their involvement
with the treatment research project. However, the main
elements of the assessment are applicable to clinical
practice as well.

Drinking Assessment

To assess his drinking, we used a clinical interview to
ask Carl about his drinking history and perceptions
of his current drinking. A handheld Breathalyzer was
used at the beginning of each session to assess his current
BAL. In addition, we used two structured interviews,
the TLFB (Sobell & Sobell, 1995) and the Alcohol
section of the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview—Substance Abuse Module (CIDI-SAM;
Robins et al., 1988), to obtain a more complete picture
of his drinking. Maria was present for all interviews
and contributed additional information.

The TLFB inquires about drinking behavior on each
day in a set window of time before treatment. For this
study, we asked about Carl’s drinking in the prior 6
months, cueing his recall of drinking by noting other
salient events in his and Maria’s lives, such as social
events, medical appointments, holidays, and other celebrations.
The TLFB revealed that Carl had drunk alcohol
virtually every day of the previous 6 months. His
only abstinent day was when he and some friends were
arrested for attempted breaking and entering. His preferred
beverages were beer and vodka, and he reported
that the most he drank on any single day was about
32 drinks. His usual consumption was in the range of
10–12 drinks daily. Carl met DSM-IV (the system in


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

effect at the time of assessment) and DSM-5 criteria for
a diagnosis of severe alcohol dependence with physiological
dependence. He had been drinking since high
school and reported having his first problems as a result
of alcohol at the age of 25. Carl had experienced a variety
of problem consequences of his use: three arrests
for DWI, one arrest for breaking and entering, warnings
from job supervisors for intoxication on the job,
problems in his relationship with his wife, and the feeling
that he had neglected his responsibilities to his wife
and sons. He had experienced numerous blackouts and
reported many signs of physical dependence, including
morning drinking, a sense of “panic” when he thought
he would not be able to obtain a drink when he wanted
one, and drinking throughout the day. However, Carl
said that he had never experienced any of the physical
symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. He also reported
no health or emotional problems associated with his
drinking. When asked about his goals for treatment,
Carl indicated that his own preference was to cut down
and to drink moderately, but that his wife insisted on
abstinence, and he was willing to work toward that
goal.

We used two assessment techniques to identify antecedents
to Carl’s drinking, the DPQ (Menges et al.,
2008) and self-recording cards. The DPQ was used to
assess Carl’s and Maria’s perceptions of drinking antecedents.
Carl completed the DPQ by checking off all
antecedents that applied to his drinking in the previous
6 months, and Maria completed the measure as well,
to indicate her views of his drinking. They also were
asked to indicate what they thought were the most influential
antecedents. Both perceived environmental
influences as being most important to Carl’s drinking,
citing as the most salient settings bars and his home,
afternoons when he was not working, any celebratory
occasions, and being around others who were drinking.

The second most important set of drinking cues pertained
to their relationship, with Carl citing arguments,
anger, feeling nagged, or having a good time together
as antecedents. The third area of concern that both Carl
and Maria cited was physiological antecedents, primarily
restlessness and fatigue.

Carl used daily self-recording cards throughout the
treatment to record drinks and drinking urges. Reviewing
the information he recorded and discussing events
associated with drinking or drinking urges made it
clear that being with heavy-drinking friends was an
important component of Carl’s drinking. The selfrecording
cards also clarified factors associated with

his feelings of “restlessness.” When Carl and Maria
were together and the children were being active, if he
wanted to leave or go somewhere, then he would get
restless and irritable, and want to drink to “take the
edge off.” Finally, it was apparent that Carl felt like
drinking whenever Maria reminded him of a commitment
that he had made (even something simple, such as
bringing a book to her apartment), when she tried to get
him to commit to any responsible course of action, or
when he felt “trapped.”

We used questionnaires and self-recording cards
to assess how Maria coped with Carl’s drinking. She
recorded her perceptions of his drinking each day on
a Likert scale (None, Light, Moderate, or Heavy) and
recorded her daily marital satisfaction as well. Her responses
antecedent to and consequent to drinking episodes
were discussed in the therapy sessions. In addition,
both partners completed a modified version of the
Coping Questionnaire (Orford et al., 2005).

Data from these assessment sources made it apparent
that Maria often questioned Carl about his actions,
threatened him, or pleaded with him not to drink. She
had reacted to his drinking in a number of negative
ways—by separating from him, calling the police, and
refusing to have sex with him. At the same time, she
had made serious efforts to support him and encourage
his abstinence by doing positive things with Carl when
he did not drink, doing nice things for him, or talking
about positive things they could do together if he did
not drink.

Marital Relationship

We assessed the couple’s relationship by administering
the ACQ (Margolin et al., 1983) and the DAS (Spanier,
1976), and by viewing a videotape of the couple discussing
a problem in their relationship. Maria had a
number of major concerns about their relationship. In
addition to Carl’s drinking, she was concerned about
his apparent lack of responsibility, citing his unwillingness
to work, to care for the children, or to be independent
of his mother. In general, Maria felt that Carl could
not be relied upon for concrete or emotional support. A
second concern that she expressed was their role definitions.
She felt that Carl dictated her role to her, and
that she allowed him to do so. She often felt angry and
resentful as a result. Finally, she cited Carl’s mother as
a problem, describing her as an “enabler” who rescued
Carl from his problems and made no demands upon
him. She stated that when she and Carl first dated, they


Alcohol Use Disorders

liked to drink, stay out late, ride motorcycles, and have
a good time, but she felt that it was now time to “move
forward” with their lives and “get somewhere.”

Carl had fewer marital concerns. He disliked Maria’s
“nagging” him or discussing his drinking, stating
at one point, “If I had a different wife, I wouldn’t have
a drinking problem.” He also disliked her “persistence”
in wanting to discuss topics at length and her “attitude
change” when he drank.

A videotape of their interactions revealed several
communication problems. Carl and Maria interrupted
each other frequently and did not listen to each other’s
comments. Each made frequent sarcastic and biting
comments about the other, usually stating these with a
smile and a funny comment. Maria complained about
her excessive responsibilities, and Carl criticized her
for not fulfilling her responsibilities but refused to acknowledge
any responsibilities of his own.

Despite these considerable marital problems, they
enjoyed each other’s company, shared many activities
and pleasures (e.g., fishing, going to parks with the
children), and had a very positive sexual relationship.
Maria said of their relationship, “We get along great
when I don’t demand anything.”

Behavioral Formulation

Carl’s drinking appeared to have developed in a social
context, with virtually all his drinking occurring
within social groups with similar drinking patterns.
The pattern was reinforced by these positive social interactions,
both with friends and (early in their relationship)
with Maria. He had developed significant tolerance
for alcohol, so that he could consume increasingly
large amounts, resulting in a pattern of daily drinking
with some signs of physical dependence on alcohol.
For Carl, alcohol provided a number of positive consequences:
He enjoyed the tastes and sensations associated
with drinking, the social context of drinking, and
the feelings of relaxation that drinking engendered.
Although he had accumulated a number of significant
negative consequences of drinking, none had affected
his internal perceptions of himself or of alcohol. From
his perspective, negative consequences were imposed
on him by others—the police, job supervisors, and his
wife. In addition, Carl had been able to avoid responsibility
for his actions in many areas of his life. When he
did not work, he was able to live with his mother, who
shielded him from the negative consequences of not
working by providing shelter and food for him. When

Carl’s wife made demands that he experienced as aversive,
he avoided or ignored her. To some degree, his
problems with alcohol were accentuated by their different
developmental stages: Maria was ready to move to a
more adult stage of life, with increased responsibilities
and long-term goals; Carl, in contrast, wanted to maintain
the lifestyle and behavior patterns of his early 20s.

Despite Carl’s externalizing attributions for his problems
and his tendency to avoid negative consequences
and responsibility, his wife and children were important
to him, and he did not want to lose them from his
life. Therefore, he came to treatment to maintain these
desired reinforcers, but not necessarily to make the behavior
changes his wife saw as necessary for them to
have a successful long-term marriage.

As treatment progressed (see below), Carl engaged
in a variety of maneuvers to maintain the relationship
but avoid behavior change, and his wife, and at times
the therapist, reinforced these behaviors. Maria had a
limited repertoire of effective ways to obtain positive
reinforcers for herself. She appeared to expect most
positive feelings to come from external sources, and
nagging and criticizing were the only verbal behaviors
she used to try to get what she wanted. She reinforced
Carl’s drinking by continuing to have contact with
him but engaged in aversive negative verbal behavior
at the same time. She placed responsibility for her
happiness with Carl, stating that she could not work
(something she enjoyed a great deal) until he stopped
drinking and was more responsible, and that she could
not lose weight until he stopped drinking and she was
less upset.

As a couple, Carl and Maria lacked the verbal skills
to discuss these very major problems. Aversive control,
avoidance of responsibility, and lack of empathic communication
characterized their interactions.

Preparing the Client for Change

Carl and Maria were seen together for all phases of the
evaluation. In the initial evaluation, both spouses were
asked to describe their perceptions of Carl’s drinking,
their relationship, and how each had attempted to cope
with Carl’s drinking. By seeing the couple together, I
communicated my view that the drinking was intimately
connected to their relationship, and that each spouse
would need to examine his/her own behavior to effect
positive changes. At the end of the evaluation, I provided
them with feedback about the main difficulties
that I perceived (as summarized earlier), and oriented


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

them to the plan for treatment. In discussing the treatment
plan, I covered the following:

“We have asked you to come to treatment as a couple.
This is because drinking affects many areas of
your life, including your marriage and your family. I
know from what you have said, Maria, that you have
tried many different ways to cope with Carl’s drinking,
and that you have been angry and frustrated at
times. It is clear that you have tried to help, but it
seems, Carl, that you mostly have resented it when
Maria has said anything about your drinking. During
treatment we will look at your drinking, how you
have tried to cope with it, and how the two of you are
getting along as a couple. Right now the two of you
are separated, and you have a lot of concerns about
your relationship. As we go along in the therapy, I
will help you improve your communication, and I
will ask you to try new ways to spend time together
and discuss problems. The therapy will focus on
three main topics—your drinking, Carl, how you,
Maria, have coped with it, and how to cope in ways
that work better for both of you, and for your relationship
with each other.”

In addition to this overall orientation, which both
Carl and Maria felt captured their goals for the treatment,
we discussed Carl’s drinking goals in more detail
and made plans for how to achieve those goals. As
indicated earlier, Carl’s preferred drinking goal was
moderate drinking. However, Maria felt strongly that
she wanted him to abstain, and he had agreed to that
goal prior to coming to treatment. Since he had been
drinking daily and showed evidence of tolerance to alcohol,
I was concerned that he would not be able to stop
drinking without assistance. I therefore discussed with
him the possibility of being detoxified under medical
supervision:

“I am concerned, Carl, that it will be difficult for you
to stop drinking on your own. You drink every day
and have been drinking a lot. On the questionnaires,
you indicated that you ‘panic’ if you think that you
will not be able to get any alcohol, and you typically
drink throughout the day. All of these things suggest
to me that you may be ‘hooked’ on alcohol, and that
your body will have a strong reaction to going without
any alcohol at all. The easiest way to get through
the first few days without drinking is to check into

a hospital detoxification program, and I would like
you to consider it.”

Carl had a very negative reaction to the thought of
being hospitalized. He was afraid of being “locked up,”
and said, “I know that I would go crazy. I can’t stand
being confined. After 24 hours I would just have to
leave. It’s not a good idea.” I was most interested in engaging
Carl in treatment, so I thought it inappropriate
to try to force Carl to enter a detoxification center. I was
certain that if I made brief hospitalization a prerequisite
to further treatment, he would leave treatment completely.
Therefore, we developed a plan to achieve abstinence.
The plan had two major components: (1) Carl
was to come to therapy sessions sober, and his BAL
would be verified by breath alcohol test reading; and

(2) Carl would set goals to reduce his drinking gradually,
with a target date for abstinence 6 weeks hence. If
he was not able to achieve either goal, then we would
reevaluate the need for supervised detoxification. He
was amenable to this agreement, as was Maria.
Process of Treatment

The course of treatment is described sequentially
to provide the reader with the clearest picture of the
progress and pitfalls of a fairly typical therapy case.
The treatment covered several major areas: (1) helping
Carl to reduce, then stop his drinking; (2) teaching
Carl skills to maintain abstinence; (3) enhancing Carl’s
perception of his drinking as problematic; (4) teaching
Maria more constructive coping strategies; (5) teaching
the couple how to engage in positive interactions;
and (6) teaching the couple mutual problem-solving
techniques. In addition, as treatment progressed, we
focused on some other areas of individual behavioral
change for Maria.

Intake and Sessions 1–2

At the initial intake session, Carl had a BAL of greater
than 400 mg%. Although he did not show gross signs of
intoxication, he was belligerent, and the clinician doing
the intake did not feel that he could conduct a reasonable
intake interview. He suggested that Carl receive
medical attention because his BAL was so high, but
Carl refused, and the clinician rescheduled the intake.
At the rescheduled appointment, Carl was sober and
able to provide information, to give informed consent


Alcohol Use Disorders

for the research aspects of the program, and to schedule
the baseline data collection session.

At the first treatment session, however, Carl again
had an elevated BAL (120 mg%). He acknowledged
only having had “a couple of beers” and insisted that
he was fine. We briefly discussed Carl’s and Maria’s
concerns and goals, but I suggested that we would not
be able to have a very productive session with Carl’s
BAL so high. (My general policy is to reschedule a
treatment session if the client’s BAL is greater than 50
mg%.) Carl agreed to come to the next session sober
and to have no more than four drinks per day. I gave
Carl and Maria self-recording cards, on which I asked
them to record drinks, drinking urges, and marital satisfaction
on a daily basis. Carl was given one card for
each day and was asked to record each drink he actually
consumed, to note urges to drink not followed
by drinking, and to note on the back of the card the
situations in which he drank or had urges to drink (see
Figure 13.3).

Maria received one card to use for the entire week. I
asked her to write on the card a daily estimate of Carl’s
drinking (None, Light, Moderate, or Heavy) and also to
record her estimate of the strength of his urges to drink
that day. She also made a daily rating of her marital
satisfaction (see Figure 13.4).

When Carl and Maria came to the second session,
his BAL was again elevated, at 60 mg%. He reported
drinking about four beers during the day. We continued
the discussion of detoxification, and Carl said that he
felt he was addicted to alcohol. He said that he would
consider detoxification, and we scheduled a phone conversation
to discuss detoxification further. After we
spoke twice by phone, Carl again decided that he did
not want to be hospitalized. He did not use the selfrecording
cards during these first 2 weeks, although
Maria completed his cards for him while they drove
to the treatment session. I did not feel that I had a clear
picture of Carl’s drinking, but it was clear that he was
continuing to drink daily.

Sessions 3–5

Carl came to the third session with a BAL of 0 mg%.
He again reiterated his desire to stop drinking without
hospitalization, and we worked out a plan for him to
reduce his number of drinks gradually to zero over a
6-week time period. In addition to setting drinking
goals, we began to discuss a behavioral-analytic view

of drinking. To introduce the couple to a behavioral
way of thinking about their drinking, I said:

“Together we are going to observe carefully and
analyze all the factors that seem to be part of your
drinking. I think that we can look at your drinking
and figure out what kinds of situations lead you to
feel like drinking. If we can figure this out, then we
can work together to come up with alternatives for
these situations. We will be using these sheets, called
‘triggers’ sheets, to analyze your drinking. Let’s go
through one of these together.”

I then asked Carl to identify a recent drinking situation.
He indicated that he liked to drink when he went
fishing. As we spoke, I completed the boxes on the
“triggers” sheet, illustrated in Figure 13.7. Carl had a
fairly nonpsychological view of his drinking. He described
his thoughts as “I want to get some beer” and
his feelings as “happy.” He viewed drinking when fishing
as having positive consequences—“I have a blast.”
He felt that the only negative consequences came from
Maria, who would be angry when he came home.

Carl and Maria grasped the behavioral analysis
quickly and found it a comfortable way to conceptualize
his drinking. As homework, I then asked both
of them to complete the DPQ and bring it to the next
treatment session. I gave them additional self-recording
cards to use for the week.

Carl also came to the fourth session sober but reported
heavy drinking over the weekend. The graph
of his weekly alcohol consumption during treatment is
reproduced in Figure 13.8. Carl’s and Maria’s average
weekly marital satisfaction ratings are reproduced in
Figure 13.9. Carl expressed no concern about his continued
heavy drinking, and showed no evidence that he
was trying to cut down.

“I am glad that you have come to the last two sessions
sober—I know that’s not easy for you, and it does
show that you want treatment to succeed. However,
I am concerned that you have not cut down at all
between sessions. If anything, your drinking seems
a bit heavier. It’s not clear to me whether you don’t
really want to cut down, or whether you just don’t
know how.”

Carl said that it was hard to cut down, but that he was
committed to stop drinking because he wanted to have

Maria and the boys back again. We then discussed a
number of potential strategies to help him avoid drinking,
such as sleeping (his suggestion) or having alternative
beverages available in the house (my suggestion),
or going back to work (Maria’s suggestion). He was reluctant
to commit to any plans, and Maria challenged
whether he was really willing to stop drinking.

To respond to Carl’s ambivalence, I suggested that
we examine consequences of his drinking other than
Maria’s disapproval and the couple’s arguments about
his drinking. Carl was unable to think of any other adverse
consequences. I asked him about his legal problems
from the DWIs and the arrest for breaking and
entering, but Carl said that he did not believe alcohol
had anything to do with the latter charge, and that DWI
laws were “ridiculous.” He also indicated that he was
still driving, even though he did not have a driver’s license,
and that he would continue to drive even if his
license was revoked for 10 years (a real possibility,
given that he had had three DWIs in less than 10 years,
with two in the same month). Carl expressed a similar
lack of concern about any other aspects of his drinking
but again said that he was willing to stop because
of his commitment to the marriage and his children.
I made a list of the negative consequences that he or
Maria had reported at various times and asked him to
review the list at least twice daily, and to think about
which of these consequences were of concern to him.

Carl reported looking at the list “once or twice” between
sessions, but he was relatively indifferent to the
content.

Despite my concern about Carl’s relative lack of motivation
to change, I decided to proceed with a behavioral
analysis of his drinking. I thought that if we could
identify a discrete set of antecedents to drinking, and if
Carl could successfully avoid drinking in some of these
situations some of the time, his motivation to change
might increase as his self-efficacy increased. We discussed
two other drinking situations in the session
and, as homework, I had him complete two behavioral
chains at home. A complete summary of the behavioral
analysis of his drinking is provided in Figure 13.10.

Carl came to the next treatment session with a BAL
of 118 mg% and reported drinking heavily for the last
several days prior to the treatment session. After a
lengthy discussion, he agreed to go for detoxification.
Carl said he was afraid of the hospitalization and concerned
that he would not be able to be abstinent after
detoxification. I tried to emphasize that the detoxification
was only the first step in treatment, and that we
would be working together to help him learn ways of
coping without drinking.

He also expressed his belief that life would not be
fun if he did not drink. Maria oscillated between encouraging
Carl to get detoxified and saying to me that
he was only agreeing to the detoxification to get out

Alcohol Use Disorders

of my office. Because he was so concerned, I had him
call the detoxification center from my office to ask any
questions he had. He did so, and scheduled himself for
admission the next day.

Sessions 6–8

Carl did not admit himself for detoxification and stated
again that he could not face being “locked up.” He was
still drinking daily, making minimal efforts to decrease
his drinking. I suggested outpatient detoxification and
gave him the phone number of a physician colleague
who supervised outpatient detoxification, but I had little
expectation that he would follow through with that
referral either. Carl continued to express willingness to
be in treatment and to change his drinking, and I decided
to continue despite my doubts about whether he
had sufficient incentives to change. We completed the
behavioral analysis of his drinking during the sixth session
and identified several of Maria’s actions that were
antecedents to his drinking, including reminding him
about responsibilities, her slow pace when they had an
appointment and there was a lot to do to get themselves
and their children ready to go out, and her comments
about his drinking.

At one point during Session 6, Carl said, “You know,
Maria has a real temper. You should ask her what she
did to me at the beach.” Maria responded immediately
by saying, “Show Barbara your arms.” Carl rolled up
his sleeves, revealing a number of scratches and bruises
covering his lower forearms. Maria then explained that
she had been intensely frustrated with Carl because of
his drinking, and often grabbed him, scratched him, or
tried to hit him in the chest or abdomen when she was
angry. The behavior had started in the last 4 months,
and she found it very upsetting. She also indicated her
concern that she might become abusive toward her
children and admitted that she sometimes used physical
punishment when she was angry at them. Although
Maria’s anger and frustration were not surprising and
are common reactions of partners of people with alcoholism,
the physical aggression, particularly in the
absence of any physical abuse from Carl, was less
usual. We discussed her behavior toward the children
in great detail because I was concerned about whether
there was any evidence of child abuse. She reported,
and Carl confirmed, that she had never bruised, cut,
or injured the children in any way, and that they had
never had to take either of the children to a physician
or emergency room because of her discipline. Both re


ported the belief that physical punishment, in the form
of “swats on the bum” or physically removing the child
from a dangerous situation, was an appropriate form of
discipline. However, Maria felt that she did not always
discipline the children rationally, and that she would
occasionally hit them on the arm, or pull too hard when
removing them from a situation. From the couple’s
reports, I did not believe that Maria was abusing the
children, but I thought it was important to address her
concerns in the therapy. I instructed Maria to use the
self-recording cards to write down any times in the next
2 weeks when she felt that she was reacting too strongly
to the children or when she was physically aggressive
toward Carl.

Over the next two sessions, Carl began to decrease
his drinking substantially and was abstinent for each
treatment session. Carl and Maria had begun to spend
more time together, and they reported that their time together
was more positive. They had a family barbecue
and went fishing at the beach with the children.

Maria had been faithful in recording her reactions
to her children, noting two times each week when she
either slapped one of the children on the arm or felt
that she grabbed him too hard. We discussed the antecedents
to these incidents and identified several salient
aspects: Maria was tired, the child was tired, and she
attempted to tell him to do something when she could
not enforce it (she was across the room or had her hands
full). In each situation, she repeated her verbal instructions
to the boy several times to no avail, then felt angry
and stomped across the room and grabbed him. We
discussed alternative strategies, and I emphasized the
importance of being able to follow through on a verbal
instruction immediately rather than allowing herself to
get frustrated. She quickly picked up on my suggestions
and also expressed relief at being able to discuss her
concerns. After the 2-week period, Maria reported no
further instances of excessive physical reaction to the
boys, and reported feeling more in control of herself
as a parent again. Carl’s observations confirmed her
reports.

At the same time that we discussed Maria’s problems
with disciplining the children, we began to implement
some self-management planning techniques for Carl. I
suggested to Carl that it would be easier not to drink
if he had ideas about how to handle certain triggers
without alcohol. He could avoid situations or rearrange
them to minimize the importance of alcohol in the situation.
We used a self-management planning sheet to assist
in the process (see Figure 13.11).

figUre 13.11. Sample self-management planning sheet.

We selected fishing as a topic for self-management
planning because it was a high frequency, high-drinking
activity for him. Carl had a number of ideas about how
to fish without alcohol. These included taking his older
son, taking his wife, or inviting an older friend who
was an excellent fisherman and did not drink at all.
In addition, Carl thought that if he bought soft drinks
the night before he went fishing and filled his cooler
with the sodas before he left the house, he would be
less tempted to stop by the liquor store at the end of his
block. For homework, I asked Carl to implement this
plan, and to develop another self-management plan for
getting together with a friend without drinking.

Carl implemented the fishing plan successfully and
also planned to ask his friend Scott to play tennis,
then go to a fast-food restaurant to eat because alcohol
would not be available there. Although Carl saw no obstacles
to implementing this plan, he never used it, and
could provide no reasons for not following it up. He did,
however, tell Scott that he was trying not to drink, and
his friend reacted positively and supportively.

The other major topic of these several sessions was
reinforcement for changes in Carl’s drinking. Because
Carl was so ambivalent about changing his drinking,
I thought it particularly important that he experience
some positive consequences for decreased drinking
and for abstinence. I also wanted to give Maria some
positive rather than coercive ways to interact with Carl
about his drinking. In introducing this topic, I suggested
that they both should think about ways to make
abstinence and reduced drinking more positive. I first
suggested that Maria might give Carl positive feedback
when he was not drinking, but he reacted quite nega


tively to this suggestion, saying, “I would just think it
was another one of her sneaky ways to try to pressure
me to stop. I don’t want her to say anything.” In continuing
with this discussion, I asked whether there was
anything that Maria could do that would make abstinence
worthwhile to him, and Carl suggested that she
could refrain from talking about alcohol and spend
time with him without being “picky.” They decided on
several mutually enjoyable activities to share when he
was not drinking, such as sharing a shrimp dinner, and
on having Maria tell Carl when she was enjoying their
time together. They were able to implement these plans
successfully, and although Carl drank while they were
together, the amount was substantially less on these occasions.


Sessions 9–11

By this point in the treatment, Carl had reduced his
drinking to approximately three to six drinks per day,
but he had not abstained from drinking at all. His reports
of urges to drink had also begun to decrease.
Maria reported high marital satisfaction almost every
day (a rating of 7 on a 1- to 7-point scale), and they were
spending most of their free time either at her apartment
or at the home of Carl’s mother. However, in the therapy
sessions they began to argue more frequently, with their
conflict revolving around two major topics—Maria’s
desire to move to North Carolina and her feeling that
Carl was not emotionally supportive of her. I began to
implement some structured communication training
with them, teaching them skills that included allowing
the other to finish before speaking, reflective listening,


Alcohol Use Disorders

and making specific positive requests. These sessions
were supplemented with handouts about communication.
After reading the first handout, which covered
basic topics, such as the value of being polite and respectful
of one’s spouse, and some of the sources of bad
communication, they came into the session absolutely
surprised at the notion that calling each other names
(e.g., “idiot,” “asshole,” or “shithead”) could have any
negative impact on their relationship. They had begun
to use positive rather than negative communication at
home and were pleased with the impact it had on their
conversations.

Although we were making progress in the treatment,
I was concerned that Carl was still drinking every day,
and I relayed this concern to him. Carl stated that he believed
he could now stop, and he agreed to be abstinent
for 2 days in the following week. The first week that
he agreed to this contract, Carl did not want to discuss
strategies for abstinence, and he was unsuccessful. The
second week we discussed very specific plans for how
he would abstain. He planned to be with Maria and the
children for part of each day, and he decided not to buy
more beer to have in his mother’s house those days. In
addition, he would stock up on soft drinks and plan to go
to bed early. I also suggested that he might use Maria as
a support in his attempts to abstain. I often encourage a
client to find someone with whom to discuss urges, and
the partner can be a good source of support. He again
was resistant to involving Maria, saying, “I wouldn’t tell
her that I wanted to drink—all I’d get is a lecture.” I suggested
that he usually disliked her comments because
they were unsolicited, but in this situation, he would be
in charge because he would be the person concerned
about his drinking. He responded positively to this reframing.
I then asked him whether there was anything
Maria could say that would be helpful to him, and he
suggested that she tell him it was his choice. Maria
indicated that it would be difficult not to lecture, but
she agreed to a role play. They imagined that they were
driving to the beach, and Carl said, “I want to stop to
pick up a six-pack on the way down.” Maria answered,
“It’s your choice if you want to, but we could stop to get
some sodas instead, if you want.” Carl was amazed at
how much he liked her response, and although Maria
acknowledged that it was very difficult to be that neutral,
she liked feeling that it was not her responsibility to
prevent him from drinking. They agreed to try out such
a discussion once during the coming week.

Carl was not successful in maintaining any abstinent
days, although he did implement most of the rest of the

plans and drank only one beer on each of the 2 target
days. However, he did not tell Maria about any of his
urges to drink. He again expressed little concern about
not meeting his goals. During the session, Carl and
Maria announced that they were going to North Carolina
for a 2-week trip. Carl knew a contractor who had
offered him work there, and Maria was intrigued with
the possibility of moving to an area with a lower cost
of living and more rural environment in which to raise
the children. She stated that she would not move while
Carl was still drinking, but they both decided that a trip
to explore the possibilities was appealing.

Sessions 12–15

Carl and Maria returned from their 2-week trip very
enthusiastic about North Carolina. They believed that
work was available, the cost of living was clearly lower,
and both of them liked the area they had visited. Maria
said again that she would not move unless Carl had been
abstinent for a considerable length of time because she
did not want to leave her family if she could not depend
on Carl. He again said that he would stop drinking. I
had taken advantage of the break in the therapy to review
all of my progress notes and to think about the
couple with a bit more detachment. It was clear to me
that although Carl had agreed to abstinence because
of Maria’s pressure, he wanted instead to reduce his
drinking. However, he had dealt with this conflict by
providing verbal reassurances that his behavior would
change, without accompanying behavior changes. He
had implemented only a few of the behavioral plans
that we had developed, and I did not think that the lack
of implementation reflected a skills deficit. I had decided
to point out Carl’s behavioral inconsistencies at
this treatment session.

To initiate this discussion, I told Carl and Maria that
I wanted to discuss their progress so far. I emphasized
the positive changes that they had made so far: Carl had
decreased his drinking substantially; he had developed
some skills to assist him in drinking less; their communication
had begun to improve; they were spending
time together that was mutually enjoyable; and they
had begun to consider possible long-term plans together.
I noted, however, that Carl had made a series of
promises about his drinking on which he had not followed
through. I read them several passages from my
progress notes, noting Carl’s initial target date for abstinence,
and his broken agreements about detoxification
and abstinent days. I suggested two alternative explana



CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

tions to them: Either Carl did not want to stop drinking
completely but felt that he had to agree to abstinence to
keep Maria happy or he really could not stop drinking
and needed further assistance to do so. By framing my
explanations this way, I tried to avoid labeling Carl as
dishonest or unmotivated to change. I also suggested
that Maria had helped Carl to keep drinking by reporting
high marital satisfaction even though he was still
drinking, and that perhaps reduced drinking really was
acceptable to her as well. Both reacted quite strongly
to my feedback. Carl said, “At first I didn’t want to
stop, but now it doesn’t seem that bad. I’m not drinking
enough now for it to mean anything, so I’ll just quit. It’s
no big deal, and I don’t want to disappoint you.” Maria
said, “I always feel like Carl is just saying whatever he
has to say to get me or you off his back. But I have been
so much happier since he cut down that I kind of lost
sight of that fact that he’s still drinking. I am afraid to
move anywhere with him while he’s still drinking at
all. It was so bad before, I don’t want to go back to that.”

After this conversation, Carl denied that he preferred
moderate drinking and announced that he was going to
“quit for good.” Over the next 2 weeks, Carl had one
drinking day each week—one beer the first week and
two beers the second week. Although we discussed a
variety of behavioral coping strategies, such as developing
behavioral alternatives for drinking situations,
rehearsing strategies for refusing drinks, and using
various strategies for coping with urges, Carl deemphasized
their importance. Instead, he focused on cognitive
coping strategies: When he had urges to drink, he
would think about reasons not to drink (“It’s not worth
it—Maria and the kids are more important”). Or he
would use delay tactics (“I won’t have anything right
now—if I still feel like drinking at 5:00 [or some other,
later time during the day], then I’ll have a beer”). Or
he would deemphasize the positive aspects of alcohol
(“One or two beers won’t do anything for me, and I
don’t want to get blasted”).

Carl and Maria also began to discuss their long-term
goals. I asked them to write down how they would like
their lives to be in 5 years. Carl wrote down the following3:


Comfortable place to live for Maria and this kids. Good
schools, backyard. Get finances in order; save money,
consolidate bills, improve credit. Maintain stable income
ie. steady construction work or other. Obtain a
loving relationship with Maria. Self improvement:
manage money better, listen to Maria more objectivly,

secure steadier employment. Maria: better self discipline,
controll temper, improve self confidence, weight
loss, less pestimistic in dialy matters. ie. scared of bugs,
traffic, mishaps, etc.

Maria wrote down remarkably similar 5-year goals:

Five years from now—37 years old; Jonathan 8 years,
Marc 7 years. We are living in North Carolina in a
rented house. I’m working, Carls working the boys are
in school. We have two cars. Carl is 5 yrs sober. I’m
4 years thin. We are two yrs away from getting credit
back from filing bankruptcy. Some nights we will be together
as a family to relax or to go to a baseball or soccer
game of Jonathan’s or Marc’s. Other nights I will be
out to socialize or run errands. Other nights Carl will
do the same. We will be somewhat financialy comfortable.
Three things I want out of life:

Maria: Carl:
calmness, thinness, motivation, sobriety,
to feel secure, a car, responsability,
money, independence, contentedness
control over my life

Because Carl and Maria’s goals were so similar, I
asked them if I could read them aloud. Both were amenable
to this suggestion, and I did so. They reacted
quite positively and felt encouraged; because their longterm
goals were so similar, they could work together to
achieve these goals. I began to teach them skills related
to assertiveness and problem solving, discussing ways
to implement these skills both in their relationship and
in other interpersonal situations.

Sessions 16–18

Carl abstained from drinking from Session 15 to the
end of the treatment. He reported a few urges to drink,
but these soon decreased. However, he discussed very
strong reactions to not drinking. He felt sad, saying
that he missed drinking and felt that he had lost
something important to him. He also said that it was
frustrating because he always had been able to drink
when he felt bad, but now he could not do so. I tried
to reframe his feelings for him, noting that his ability
to recognize that he missed alcohol was an important
step toward being able to reorganize his life without
it, and that his reaction suggested that he was serious
about his intentions not to drink. Carl seemed to find
the reframing helpful, but he continued to find abstinence
uncomfortable.


Alcohol Use Disorders

As Carl remained abstinent, his marital satisfaction
ratings decreased. Previously Carl had reported fairly
high marital satisfaction, but as he stopped drinking
he became increasingly unhappy. When I asked him
about his ratings, he said that he felt they were “going
nowhere” in terms of reconciling. We had begun assertion
and problem-solving training, and I suggested
that Carl could use these skills to express his feelings
to Maria more directly. They had a positive discussion
during the session about his feelings and about wanting
to reconcile, and her concerns about how difficult that
would be, with each using some of the positive skills
on which we had worked. Both agreed that they now
wanted to live together again, but it would be difficult
to develop a plan to do so. We used structured problemsolving
techniques over two treatment sessions to develop
a plan. The major impediment to reconciliation
was financial. Maria was receiving welfare, but if either
she or Carl began to work, they would receive less
public assistance. However, to be able to live together,
they would have to save sufficient money for a security
deposit and first month’s rent. They finally decided that
Maria would begin to work a few hours a week as a
hairdresser, working “under the table,” and that Carl
would care for the children while she worked. If that
worked well, then Carl would begin to look for work
again; once both were working, they would move in
with his mother for a limited period of time to save
money for the deposits and rent, then either obtain an
apartment together in New Jersey or find a trailer to rent
in North Carolina and move. They also used problemsolving
techniques to develop a plan to deal with their
other debts.

Termination

Because Carl and Maria were part of a clinical research
study, we had to terminate treatment after 18 sessions
(including the sessions when he was intoxicated). They
had made significant progress during treatment: Carl
had been abstinent for more than a month; Maria had
learned more effective ways to discipline the children
and no longer reported concerns about being overly
punitive to them; the couple’s relationship was significantly
improved; and they had a constructive plan for
reconciliation. I was concerned that Carl was still uncomfortable
with abstinence, and I thought that he had
acquired only a few effective coping strategies to deal
with triggers for drinking. We had not worked directly
on Carl’s style of avoiding responsibility except by fol


lowing through on his commitment to abstinence and
long-term goal setting. Whether Carl would implement
his part of these agreements was relatively untested.
The couple was fairly comfortable with termination
but asked about possible follow-up treatment, inquiring
specifically about AA or other support groups that
focused on couples or on behavioral approaches to
change. I referred them to SMART, and to a couples’
AA group. The constraints of the clinical research protocol
precluded any longer-term treatment with me,
even though I thought continued treatment would be
beneficial.

Comment

Carl and Maria were a fairly typical couple. Carl’s
ambivalence about change, his entry into treatment
solely because of an external agent, and his resistance
to many behavioral interventions are fairly representative.
I believe that he began to engage in treatment
when he stopped feeling that he was the sole focus of
the treatment, after Maria began to discuss her aggressive
behavior and feelings. The second critical point in
treatment was addressing his continued drinking. I was
willing to allow them to renegotiate for a goal of moderate
drinking, but I did not think it therapeutic for Carl
to feel that he could verbally agree to abstinence but
then avoid the agreement. Addressing Carl’s behavior
directly forced him either to be assertive and renegotiate
treatment goals or to follow through on his commitment.


The role of behavioral skills training in facilitating
abstinence was less important with Carl than with
some clients. He tried various skills introduced during
the treatment but relied primarily on cognitive coping
strategies. The role of reinforcement was probably
more important in understanding his changed drinking
behavior. Carl’s marital relationship was important to
him at the beginning of treatment, and focusing in the
therapy on ways to improve that relationship increased
its reinforcement value to him. Maria’s consistency in
saying that they could reconcile only if he were abstinent,
in discussing long-term goals for the relationship,
and in seeing the possible positive life they could live in
North Carolina all contributed.

Finally, my relationship with the couple probably
contributed to the positive changes they made. I found
them a likable, appealing couple despite their difficulties.
At times, I would tease or cajole Carl into compliance,
and he commented at the end of the treatment,


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

“At first I didn’t know if I liked you or not, but then I
decided you were kind of cute, and then I realized that
you weren’t going to let up on me, so I decided that
I’d give it a try.” I tried to reinforce Maria’s ability to
take care of herself, and I suspect that she saw me as a
female role model in some ways. She often asked me
personal questions (whether I was married, how old my
son was), and gave me a desk calendar as a thank-you
gift at termination. Our research suggests that our more
experienced therapists are more successful at keeping
clients in treatment (Epstein, McCrady, Miller, &
Steinberg, 1994; Raytek, McCrady, Epstein, & Hirsch,
1999), and I suspect that being able to deal with these
complex relationships is one skill that our more experienced
therapists have acquired more fully.

Typical Problems

The problems presented in this case are fairly typical—
coming to treatment sessions intoxicated, continued
drinking during treatment, ambivalence about change,
noncompliance with assignments, and discovering new
and major problems as the therapy progresses. Lying
and failing to come to scheduled treatment sessions are
other typical obstacles that clients with drinking problems
sometimes present. By working with Carl and
Maria together, I was able to minimize these particular
difficulties because Maria was highly motivated for
treatment and very responsible about keeping scheduled
appointments. Also, by having them both record
Carl’s drinking and drinking urges, I had a clearer picture
of his drinking and was able to maintain a clear
idea of our progress (or lack thereof).

cliNical PreDictors of success
or failure

A number of factors predict the success or failure of
therapy. However, before I address these factors, it is important
to discuss definitions of “success.” In any treatment,
a minority of clients maintain long-term, uninterrupted
successful change (abstinence or nonproblem
drinking). The proportion varies with the demographic
characteristics of the population, and persons who are
married, have stable employment, a stable residence,
and no comorbid psychopathology have the best treatment
outcomes. In addition, a person’s posttreatment
environment plays an important role (Moos, Finney, &
Cronkite, 1990) in determining long-term outcomes.

Observations of the long-term instability of drinking
outcomes have led many to consider alcoholism as a
chronic, relapsing disorder, and to reconceptualize
“success” as a process rather than a static outcome;
that is, the client who learns not only effective skills to
avoid drinking or heavy drinking but also ways to cope
with relapses by minimizing their length and severity
should be considered “successful” as well. In treatment
outcome studies, investigators look at percentage
of abstinent or moderate drinking days and length of
periods of abstinence compared to periods of heavy
drinking as ways to assess relative rather than absolute
“success.” From the individual clinician’s perspective,
certain client characteristics and behaviors bode well
for the course of treatment. The client who has important
incentives to change (either internal or external)
and some recognition of a relationship between his/her
drinking and life problems is easier to treat. Complying
with early homework assignments, coming to sessions
sober, and being honest about behavior outside of the
treatment are also positive indicators. However, clinician
behavior is another important predictor of success.
Various studies have pointed to different aspects of clinician
behavior —empathy, specific goal setting and
treatment planning, developing drinking goals with the
client rather than imposing goals, and providing the client
with options for treatment—as all being associated
with better compliance with treatment.

coNclusioN

Providing treatment to persons with drinking problems
is a complex and continuously fascinating process. The
clinician is faced with decisions about matching each
client to the appropriate level of care, the setting for
treatment, and treatment modalities and techniques.
Diagnostic skills to identify concomitant medical,
psychological, psychiatric, and cognitive problems are
challenged by these clients. Therapy requires knowledge
of a range of treatment techniques, an ability to
be able to form a positive therapeutic relationship with
sometimes frustrating and difficult clients, and the ability
to “think on your feet.”

From the briefest, one-session treatments to motivate
heavy drinkers to reduce their drinking to the
complex and longer treatment provided to individuals
with severe alcohol dependence, treatment is never dull
or routine. The clinician has a large body of empirical
literature to guide the selection of treatments and a


Alcohol Use Disorders

significant clinical literature as well to illustrate clini


cal techniques and problems. And although many per


sons with drinking problems change successfully on

their own or with minimal assistance, treatment also

can provide an effective means for persons to change a

major life problem.
So this chapter concludes as it began—as a “sales

pitch” for clinicians to be knowledgeable about and re


ceptive to providing thoughtful, informed treatment to

persons with drinking problems.

Drug Use Disorders

stePheN t. hiGGiNs
stacey c. siGMoN
sarah h. heil

in this chapter we follow the case of “Bill,” a 24‑year‑old individual with cocaine use
disorder, who would ordinarily be considered to be among the most difficult types of
patients for someone administering psychological interventions. As is typical with this
population, Bill presented with not only cocaine but also alcohol use disorder; problems
with anger management; heavy use of cigarettes and marijuana; suicidal ideation; and
major interpersonal, social, and occupational problems (including a prohibition from
visiting his 5‑year‑old daughter). The fact that stephen T. Higgins and his team of close
associates have been able to create a treatment protocol for individuals such as Bill—a
protocol with strong empirical support—is in itself a remarkable achievement. But only
those most familiar with this approach have a good idea of the multifaceted nature of
this brief semistructured strategy, which includes attention to the full range of addictive
behaviors, as well as mood disturbances, interpersonal relationships, and problems in
living. Without this comprehensive approach, there seems to be no question that these
treatment strategies would not enjoy the success that they do. even clinicians or students
not working directly with addictive behaviors will benefit from being familiar with this
new generation of successful psychological approaches to drug use.—D. H. B.

Drug use disorders represent a highly prevalent and
costly public health problem in the United States and
virtually all other industrialized countries. To get a
sense of the scope of the U.S. problem, an estimated

131.2 million persons 12 years and older (51.4%) report
current alcohol use (past 30 days), 69.6 million (27.2%)
report current tobacco use, and 22.7 million (8.9%)
report current use of illicit drugs (United States Department
of Health and Human Services [USDHHS],
2012). Of course, not all current users experience adverse
effects, but a sizable proportion incur substantial
problems. An estimated 22.2 million (8.7%) Americans
12 years and older meet formal Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text
revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association,
2000) diagnostic criteria for drug abuse or dependence
within the past year, and 1.5 million (0.6%)
report being treated for a drug use problem within the
past year (USDHHS, 2012). The annual costs to the

U.S. economy associated with these problems are estimated
to exceed $600 billion (Bouchery, Harwood,
Sacks, Simon, & Brewer, 2011; Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2008; U.S. Department of Justice,
2011).
Clearly there is a tremendous need for effective treatments
for drug use disorders. This chapter focuses on
psychosocial treatments for illicit drug use disorders.
Treatments for alcohol problems are covered by Mc

Drug Use Disorders

Crady (Chapter 13, this volume) and there are several
excellent reviews available on treatments for tobacco
use disorders (e.g., Kenford & Fiore, 2004; Schnoll &
Lerman, 2006). Because the focus is on empirically
based interventions, we largely cover behavioral and
cognitive-behavioral therapies. That said, effective
contemporary treatments for drug use disorders often
entail combining psychological treatments with medications,
and this is reflected in this chapter as well. We
use a multielement intervention to illustrate details of
treatment implementation, namely, the community reinforcement
approach (CRA) plus vouchers intervention
that our group developed for outpatient treatment
of cocaine dependence. Last, the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA, 2009) has published 13 principles
of effective treatment for illicit drug abuse based on
more than 35 years of research and, when applicable,
we underscore those principles throughout the chapter
(Table 14.1).

DefiNiNG the cliNical DisorDer

Before proceeding to discussions about treatment, we
briefly discuss criteria for diagnosing drug use disorders.
In the research discussed in this chapter we have
used DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association,
2000), and we plan to use DSM-5 (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013) in future efforts. DSM-5, published
in May 2013, contains one major change from
DSM-IV-TR that merits mention (O’Brien, 2011). The
abuse and dependence diagnostic categories featured
in DSM-IV-TR were replaced in DSM-5 by a single
“substance use disorder” spectrum that comprises 11
symptoms. These symptoms, largely paralleling those
found in DSM-IV-TR, are as follows: (1) use of substance
in larger amounts or over a longer period than
was intended; (2) a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts
to cut down or control substance use; (3) a great
deal of time spent in activities necessary to obtain the
substance; (4) craving; (5) a failure to fulfill major
role obligations; (6) continued substance use despite
having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal
problems; (7) cessation or reduction in important social,
occupational, or recreational activities because of
substance use; (8) substance use in situations in which
it is physically hazardous, (9) continuation of substance
use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
physical or psychological problem that is likely to
have been caused or exacerbated by the substance, (10)

table 14.1. Principles of effective
treatment

1. No single treatment is appropriate for all individuals.
2. Treatment needs to be readily available.
3. Effective treatment attends to multiple needs of the
individual, not just his/her drug use.
4. An individual’s treatment and services plan must be
assessed continually and modified as necessary to
ensure that the plan meets his/her changing needs.
5. Remaining in treatment for an adequate period of time
is critical for treatment effectiveness (i.e., 3 months or
longer).
6. Counseling (individual and/or group) and other
behavioral therapies are critical components of effective
treatment for addiction.
7. Medications are an important element of treatment
for many patients, especially when combined with
counseling and other behavioral therapies.
8. Addicted or drug-abusing individuals with coexisting
mental disorders should have both disorders treated in
an integrated way.
9. Medical detoxification is only the first stage of addiction
treatment and by itself does little to change long-term
drug use.
10. Treatment does not need to be voluntary to be effective.
11. Possible drug use during treatment must be monitored
continuously.
12. Treatment programs should provide assessment for
HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis and other
infectious diseases, and counseling to help patients
modify or change behaviors that place themselves or
others at risk of infection.
13. Recovery from drug addiction can be a long-term
process and frequently requires multiple episodes of
treatment.
tolerance; and (11) withdrawal. The milder end of the
disorder spectrum (two to three symptoms) is comparable
to the less severe abuse category in DSM-IV-TR,
and the higher end of the spectrum (six or more symptoms)
to the more severe dependence category. All of
our research discussed below has involved individuals
who fell along the more severe or “dependence” end of
this spectrum.

Evidence does support a position that, on average,
more severe drug use disorders are associated with
poorer treatment outcome. Severity is influenced by
frequency of use, amount of drug used and route of administration,
and sociodemographics (e.g., educational


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

attainment), among other factors. There seems to be
little doubt that these factors will be positively correlated
with the number of untoward signs and symptoms
exhibited following a period of repeated drug use, and
to that extent merit careful attention in a diagnostic assessment.
For these and other reasons, we have found
DSM-IV-TR helpful in assessing the severity of cocaine
and other drug use disorders, and anticipate the
spectrum approach of DSM-5 to be even more helpful
in that regard.

assessMeNt

A comprehensive assessment is an essential first step
in effective clinical management of drug use disorders.
This section outlines the assessment practices we
used in our specialty clinic for individuals who met
DSM-IV-TR criteria for cocaine dependence and what
in DSM-5 would represent the more severe end of the
cocaine use disorder spectrum. The assessment framework
is relatively generic and can be readily applied
to other types of drug use disorders by substituting the
cocaine-specific information with pertinent information
on whatever other type of drug use disorder is the
presenting problem.

All initial clinic contacts are handled by a receptionist,
who establishes that the caller reports problems related
to drug use, is age 18 years or more, and resides
within the county in which the clinic is located. The
CRA plus vouchers treatment that we use is intensive,
requiring several clinic visits per week. Persons living
outside the county are often unable to follow such
a demanding schedule. A broader geographical range
may be possible with other, less intensive interventions.
The important matter is to have established the geographical
range that is practical for the treatment being
offered. Those who do not satisfy our basic inclusion
criteria are referred to an appropriate alternative clinic.
Those who meet the criteria receive an appointment for
an intake assessment.

Every effort is made to schedule the intake assessment
interview as soon as possible (Principle 2, Table
14.1). Scheduling the interview within 24 hours of clinic
contact significantly reduces attrition between the
initial clinic contact and assessment interview, which is
a substantial problem among those with drug use disorders
(Festinger, Lamb, Kirby, & Marlowe, 1996). Some
patients cannot come in within 24 hours, so our secondary
goal is to get them in within 72 hours.

Clients are informed that the intake interview will
take about 3 hours. This initial session is one of the
most important. Clinic staff should be aware of the client’s
potential uneasiness and try to make the person
feel at ease. Being courteous, complimenting clients on
taking this important first step toward change, respecting
the fact that some clients might be physically ill or
uncomfortable related to recent drug use and therefore
being flexible with regard to tardiness, and so forth, can
help. Accommodating the need for brief breaks, food or
drink, or a brief phone call can help as well. Throughout
all interactions we seek to be empathic and to convey
a very upbeat, “You can do it” message.

During the intake assessment, we collect detailed
information on drug use; evaluate treatment readiness;
and assess psychiatric functioning, employment/vocational
status, recreational interests, current social supports,
family and social problems, and legal issues (see
Principle 3, Table 14.1). The following instruments that
we use to obtain such information are listed in the order
in which they are typically administered. Modifications
can be readily made to our list depending on the population
being treated. We offer it only to provide an example
of what we have found to be an effective assessment
package, along with associated clinical rationales.

Self‑Administered Questionnaires

We use several questionnaires that can be completed
by the client upon arrival at the clinic for an initial intake
assessment. The intake worker greets the client,
introduces him/herself, brings the client into a private
office, and briefly but carefully informs him/her about
what to expect during the intake process. It is essential
to ask about clients’ reading ability prior to having them
complete self-administered questionnaires. If there is
doubt about reading capability, we discreetly ask clients
to read several questions aloud to get an indication
of whether they can complete the forms without staff
assistance. With poor readers, the questionnaires can
be read aloud by a staff member in a private setting.
This must be done with care and positive regard for
the discomfort that poor readers may feel under such
circumstances. Competent readers are given approximately
45 minutes to complete the forms.

We have clients complete a routine, brief demographics
questionnaire. Obtaining a client’s current
address and phone number is important, as is obtaining
the number of someone who always knows the client’s
whereabouts. This information is important for


Drug Use Disorders

purposes of outreach efforts during treatment should
the client stop coming to scheduled therapy sessions or
need to be contacted for other clinical purposes, and
contacting clients for routine posttreatment follow-up
evaluations.

The Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness
Scale (SOCRATES; Miller & Tonigan, 1996)
provides information about clients’ perceptions of the
severity of their drug use problems and their readiness
to engage in behavior to reduce their drug use. This
questionnaire provides a quantitative index of motivation
to change, which may be an important indicator of
clients’ willingness to comply with certain treatment
goals. We use three versions of the SOCRATES that
refer to specific substances (i.e., cocaine, alcohol, and
other drug use) because clients’ motivations to reduce
substance use are often drug-specific. For example, almost
all who seek treatment in our clinic are ready to
act toward changing their cocaine use, but many are
more ambivalent about changing their alcohol or marijuana
use, which are the two other forms of drug use we
deal with most frequently. Our approach is to reinforce
action the patient is ready to take with regard to cocaine
and to share empathically our empirical knowledge
about the influence of other forms of drug use on the
probability of successfully discontinuing cocaine use.
Our recommendation is that at least short-term abstinence
from all intoxicating substance use is the path
with the greatest chance of success. Use of alcohol can
directly increase the probability of cocaine use and predicts
poor outcome. Use of marijuana, which does not
predict poor outcome with regard to cocaine use per se,
is associated with problems of its own.

We use an adaptation of the Cocaine Dependency
Self-Test (Washton, Stone, & Hendrickson, 1988) as an
efficient means to collect specific information regarding
the type of adverse effects of cocaine that clients
have experienced. Systematically collected information
on the adverse effects of drug use is important. Such information
is useful in helping clients to problem-solve
regarding the pros and cons of cocaine use as part of
efforts to promote and sustain motivation for change
during the course of treatment.

A sizable proportion of clients with illicit drug use
disorders are also problem drinkers, which makes assessment
of that problem essential. As part of our alcohol
assessment we use the Michigan Alcoholism
Screening Test (MAST), a widely used, brief alcoholism
screening instrument (Selzer, 1971). Considering
that almost all clients entering treatment for cocaine

abuse and dependence use alcohol and approximately
60% meet DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for alcohol
dependence, the MAST is useful for flagging clients
with alcohol problems.

Depressed mood is another common problem among
those presenting for treatment for drug use disorders.
We use the Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II;
Beck, Steer, Ball, & Ranieri, 1996) to screen for depressive
symptomatology and readminister it on a regular
basis to monitor progress with those clients who
score in the clinical range at intake. The average BDI-II
scores of cocaine abusers entering treatment fall in the
clinical range. For most clients, those scores decrease
precipitously after 1 or 2 weeks in treatment. However,
this is not true for all clients. Therefore, it is important
to assess carefully and monitor depressive symptomatology,
and to refer the client or intervene when
symptoms do not remit. Assessing and monitoring for
suicide risk are important as well. We do so using a
protocol we developed in collaboration with our local
mental health crisis service.

The Symptom Checklist 90—Revised (SCL-90-R;
Derogatis, 1983) is also used to screen for psychiatric
symptomatology more broadly and is helpful in determining
whether a more in-depth psychiatric evaluation
is warranted. The SCL-90-R also can be easily readministered
to monitor progress or change in psychiatric
status.

After clients complete these self-administered questionnaires,
they are reviewed by clinic staff to be sure
that all questions have been completed and that the information
appears consistent. Any obvious inconsistencies
are resolved with the client.

Program Description

We find it useful to break up the data-gathering aspects
of the initial assessment between completion of the
self-administered questionnaires and initiation of the
structured interviews. We provide a brief description of
the treatment program and its philosophy at this time.
Clients are given the opportunity to ask questions or
to express any concerns they may have. The goal here
is to orient clients to what will happen in treatment, to
create an atmosphere of optimism, and to help clients
feel hopeful that they can succeed in treatment. This
description and interaction is typically brief (10–15
minutes). A therapist provides more detailed rationales
and descriptions during this same intake session, but
after the structured interviews are completed. When


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

asked questions about the treatment process, the intake
worker provides brief answers and reassures the client
that a therapist will soon be meeting with him/her to
provide much more information about the program and
how it works.

In providing the brief description, the intake worker
explains that our program is confidential and specifically
designed for persons who have problems with cocaine.
For obvious reasons, users of illicit drugs are
often quite concerned about confidentiality. Clients are
informed about the overall duration of treatment, the
recommended frequency and duration of clinic visits,
and the general foci and orientation of our treatment
approach (i.e., lifestyle changes). We explain that the
primary goals of such changes are that clients discontinue
cocaine use and make positive changes that result
in greater life satisfaction. Examples of what might
occur during treatment are provided:

“If you are interested in finding a job, the therapists
will help you with the search, with a résumé, and
with transportation and phone support, if necessary.
If you would like to go back to school, we can help
you obtain the applications, access funding and assistance,
and even take you to an interview if you
don’t have transportation. If you are having relationship
problems, relationship counseling is available.
If you don’t regularly participate in any fun activities,
we have lots of suggestions and may even take
you to some of these, like basketball, tennis, fishing,
boating, arts and crafts classes, and so forth.

“Also, we provide coping skills training. So if you
have problems controlling anger, we can help with
anger management. If you have money problems,
we can assist you with financial management. If you
have difficulty with behavior problems with your
children, we can assist you in get some help with that
problem. If you have trouble relaxing, we can work
on relaxation skills and stress management, and so
forth.”

In addition, the intake worker provides a very brief description
of our clinic’s incentive program:

“You also will participate in our incentive program.
How this works is that if you provide urine samples
that are cocaine-free, you earn points that can be
used to support your goals. What that means is, if
you stay clean, you accumulate points that can be
used to pay for activities such as going to the mov


ies, joining a gym, taking a class, buying a fishing
rod, and so forth. Your therapist will tell you more
about these things when you meet him/her after our
interview.”

Semistructured Interviews

A semistructured drug history interview (developed in
our clinic) is used to facilitate collection of information
on current and past drug use. Such detailed information
is essential for proper treatment planning.

The goal in completing a drug use history is to obtain
detailed information regarding the duration, severity,
and pattern of the client’s drug use. The accuracy of
the client’s report of drug use (amount and frequency)
is facilitated by an effective technique for reviewing
recent use (i.e., the Timeline Follow-Back Interview;
Sobell & Sobell, 1992; for a review see Hjorthoj,
Hjorthoj, & Nordendoft, 2012). Using a calendar as a
prompt, clients are asked to recall on a day-by-day basis
the number of days they used in the past week and the
amount used per occasion. Grams are typically the best
metric for determining amount of cocaine used. The
same assessment is conducted for the past 3 weeks and
as far back in time as needed for diagnostic reasons.
This technique results in a good overview of the client’s
pattern of drug use during the past 30 days. The
intake worker asks for as much clarification as possible
to obtain an accurate assessment of drug use history.
Diagnoses of abuse and dependence are made later by
master’s- or doctorate-level psychologists.

The Addiction Severity Index (ASI; McLellan, Cacciola,
Alterman, Rikoon, & Carise, 2006) is designed
to provide reliable, valid assessments of multiple problems
commonly associated with drug use, and a quantitative,
time-based assessment of problem severity in
the following areas: alcohol and drug use; employment;
and medical, legal, family, social, and psychological
functioning. The information obtained in the ASI is
quite useful for developing treatment plans that include
lifestyle change goals. It is also a useful instrument
for assessing progress at follow-up, in that it is timebased
and yields quantitative composite scores for multiple
problem areas. Training on ASI administration is
necessary to ensure that the intake worker conducts a
reliable ASI interview (for information on training in
the use of the ASI, see www.tresearch.org/training/
asi_train.htm).

A Practical Needs Assessment Questionnaire (developed
in our clinic) determines whether the client has


Drug Use Disorders

any pressing needs or crises that may interfere with initial
treatment engagement (e.g., housing, legal, transportation,
or child care). The intake worker asks specific
questions regarding current housing, child care,
legal circumstances, medical issues, and other matters
that might be of current and serious concern to the client.
Detailed information is collected on any identified
crisis. The rationale here is to identify matters that may
need immediate clinical attention. The lives of many
individuals entering treatment for drug dependence are
in chaos. The probability of engaging and keeping such
clients in treatment may be compromised if swift assistance
relative to certain acute needs is not provided,
typically in the form of referrals to community agencies
for assistance.

After completing these interviews, the intake worker
informs clients that they will be meeting with their
therapist in a few minutes. During a brief break (5–10
minutes), the intake worker completes an intake summary
sheet for the therapist taking on this new case,
along with all of the supporting intake information. The
intake worker meets briefly with the therapist to review
the case. Patients are then introduced to their therapists.
We try never to allow a patient to leave the intake interview
without a brief meeting with a therapist, so that
he/she can depart with the feeling that treatment has
begun, and with concrete plans for abstaining from cocaine
use until the next clinic visit.

In many ways this initial meeting is an orientation
session to establish rapport with the client and provide
further rationales for our treatment approach. Doing
so permits clients to develop clear expectations about
treatment. We continue with the “can do” approach, acknowledging
how hard the client and clinic staff will
have to work to succeed, but conveying a very confident
message that success can be achieved by working
together. The therapist and patient collaboratively
begin formulating an initial treatment plan during this
session. Clients are oriented to the rigorous urinalysis
testing regimen that is a central component of this
treatment. If it appears that a medication is indicated,
initial steps are taken toward implementing the relevant
medical protocols for making that happen. With the
cocaine-dependent population, we routinely use a regimen
of clinic-monitored disulfiram therapy to address
problem drinking, which also reduces cocaine use
(Carroll, Nich, Ball, McCance, & Rounsaville, 1998).
Recently we have begun using a regimen of clinicmonitored
naltrexone therapy because the prevalence
of prescription opioid abuse has increased.

Behavioral aND coGNitive‑Behavioral
theraPies for illicit DruG
use DisorDers

Conceptual Framework

Behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapies are
based largely on the concepts and principles of operant
and respondent conditioning, and social learning
theory. Within this conceptual framework, drug use is
considered learned behavior that is maintained, at least
in part, by the reinforcing effects of the pharmacological
actions of drugs in conjunction with social and
other nonpharmacological reinforcement derived from
the drug-abusing lifestyle (Higgins, Heil, & Lussier,
2004). The reliable empirical observation that abused
drugs function as reinforcers in humans and laboratory
animals provides sound scientific support for that position
(Griffiths, Bigelow, & Henningfield, 1980; Higgins
et al., 2004). Cocaine, other psychomotor stimulants,
ethanol, opioids, nicotine, and sedatives serve as
reinforcers and are voluntarily self-administered by a
variety of species. Moreover, through respondent and
operant conditioning, environmental events that previously
have been paired with drug use reliably lead
to drug-seeking behavior. Physical dependence is not
necessary for these drugs to support ongoing and stable
patterns of voluntary drug seeking and use in otherwise
healthy laboratory animals or humans. Commonalities
do not end there. Effects of alterations in drug availability,
drug dose, schedule of reinforcement, and other
environmental manipulations of drug use are consistent
and generalize across different species and types
of drug abuse (Griffiths et al., 1980; Higgins et al.,
2004). These commonalities support a theoretical position
that reinforcement and other principles of learning
are fundamental determinants of drug use, abuse, and
dependence.

Within this conceptual model, then, drug use is considered
a normal, learned behavior that falls along a
frequency continuum ranging from patterns of little use
and few problems to excessive use and many untoward
effects, including death. The same processes and
principles of learning are assumed to operate across the
continuum. All physically intact humans are assumed
to possess the necessary neurobiological systems to experience
drug-produced reinforcement; hence, they develop
patterns of drug use, abuse, and dependence. Said
differently, individuals need not have any exceptional
or pathological characteristics to develop drug abuse


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

or dependence. Clearly, genetic or acquired characteristics
(e.g., family history of substance dependence,
other psychiatric disorders) can affect the probability
of developing drug abuse or dependence (i.e., they are
risk factors), but this model assumes that such special
characteristics are not necessary for these disorders to
emerge.

Treatment is designed to assist in reorganizing the
physical and social environments of the user. The goal
is to weaken systematically the influence of reinforcement
derived from drug use and the related drug-using
lifestyle, and to increase the frequency of reinforcement
derived from healthier alternative activities, especially
those that are incompatible with continued drug
use. Below we describe the basic categories of empirically
tested and efficacious behavioral and cognitivebehavioral
therapies for achieving these overarching
goals (Carroll & Onken, 2005).

Prototypical Behavioral
and Cognitive‑Behavioral Interventions
and Empirical Support for Efficacy

At least four empirically based prototypical behavioral
and cognitive-behavioral interventions are used in the
treatment of illicit drug use disorders (Carroll & Onken,
2005). First is cognitive-behavioral/relapse prevention
therapy, which has been shown to be effective with cocaine,
methamphetamine, and other types of drug use
disorders (e.g., Carroll et al., 1994; Rawson et al., 2004;
Reback & Shoptaw, in press). Typically this approach
entails functional analysis training through which clients
learn to identify environmental antecedents and
consequences that influence their drug use. Functional
analysis is typically accompanied by skills training on
how to rearrange one’s environment to alter the probability
of drug use by either avoiding high-risk settings
or managing them effectively when contact cannot be
avoided. Cognitive strategies are often used to identify
and modify unrealistic expectations about drug use, to
cope with craving for drug use, and to change thinking
patterns that increase the likelihood of drug use.
Social skills training is often incorporated when clients
have used drugs to cope with social anxiety or when
particular skills deficits limit clients’ access to alternative,
healthier sources of reinforcement (e.g., Monti,
Rohsenow, Michalec, & Abrams, 1997). Systematic
training is included to prevent relapse, with sufficient
emphasis that the terms “cognitive-behavioral therapy”
and “relapse prevention therapy” are often used inter


changeably. There is good evidence that this approach
is efficacious in treating illicit drug use disorders (for
a meta-analysis, see Irvin, Bowers, Dunn, & Wong,
1999).

Second, contingency management is an efficacious
behavioral treatment strategy commonly used
to treat cocaine, opiate, and other types of illicit drug
use disorders (Higgins, Silverman, & Heil, 2008), as
well as other behavioral health problems (see Supplemental
Issue of Preventive Medicine on “Incentives
and Health”; Higgins, Silverman, Sigmon, & Naito,
2012). With contingency management, reinforcing and
punishing consequences are systematically used to increase
abstinence from drug use or to improve other
therapeutic goals, such as treatment attendance or medication
compliance (Higgins et al., 2008). A particular
form of contingency management, wherein clients
receive vouchers that are exchangeable for retail items
contingent on objective evidence of recent abstinence
from drug use, has become a common intervention for
clients with illicit drug use disorders. We know of at
least two meta-analyses supporting the efficacy of contingency
management with methadone maintenance
patients (Griffith, Rowan-Szal, Roark, & Simpson,
2000) and in the treatment of drug use disorders more
generally (Lussier, Heil, Mongeon, Badger, & Higgins,
2006).

Third, motivational interviewing, an efficacious intervention
with problem drinkers (Vasilaki, Hosier, &
Cox, 2006), is being used more frequently to treat illicit
drug use disorders as well. Motivational interviewing
is a brief intervention designed to facilitate behavior
change by helping clients to identify personal values
and goals, to examine whether drug use may conflict
with those values and goals, and to explore how to resolve
any ambivalence or conflict between personal
goals and values, and ongoing drug use (Miller & Rollnick,
2002). Results on the use of motivational interviewing
with illicit drug use disorders are still mixed
(e.g., Martino, Carroll, & Rounsaville, 2006; Smedslund
et al., 2011).

Fourth, behavioral couple therapy has been effective
in the treatment of illicit drug use disorders, although it
has not been as extensively investigated as alcohol use
disorders (Carroll & Onken, 2005; O’Farrell & Clements,
2012). Therapy typically emphasizes improved
communication skills. Couples are taught how to negotiate
for change in each other’s behavior to make the
relationship more reinforcing. A contract wherein the
designated client agrees to abstain from drug use and/


Drug Use Disorders

or to comply with a recommended medication regimen
is typically involved. There is also evidence that
behavioral family counseling has efficacy with adolescents
who have illicit drug use disorders (e.g., Azrin,
Donohue, Besalel, Kogan, & Acierno, 1994) as do other
family therapy interventions (e.g., Henggeler, Pickrel,
Brondino, & Crouch, 1996; Liddle et al., 2001).

It is a common practice to provide multielement
treatments for illicit drug use disorders that incorporate
many of the specific interventions we have outlined
(e.g., Bellack, Bennett, Gearson, Brown, & Yang,
2006). Indeed CRA plus vouchers, which we use to treat
cocaine dependence, incorporates all of the interventions
outlined earlier except for family therapies with
adolescents. Below we describe the CRA plus vouchers
intervention and its implementation in the treatment of
cocaine dependence. With regard to efficacy, the metaanalysis
supporting the efficacy of vouchers was noted
earlier (Lussier et al., 2006). A meta-analysis supports
the efficacy of CRA, with and without vouchers, in the
treatment of drug use disorders (Roozen et al., 2004),
and a randomized trial has demonstrated that the CRA
component is an active element of the CRA plus vouchers
treatment (Higgins et al., 2003).

CRA plus Vouchers

The recommended duration of CRA plus vouchers
therapy is 24 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of aftercare
(Budney & Higgins, 1998). The influence of
treatment duration has not yet been examined experimentally
with this or other efficacious psychosocial
treatments for drug use disorders, but a duration of 3 or
more months of care is generally recommended (Principle
5, Table 14.1).

CRA therapy in this model is delivered in individual
sessions, although CRA has been delivered effectively
in a group therapy format with alcohol-dependent clients
(Azrin, 1976). As we noted earlier, the treatment
involves two main components: CRA and vouchers.

The Community Reinforcement Approach

Before we get into the specific elements of CRA, more
general characteristics of the therapy style are worth
mentioning. Therapists try to be flexible in appointment
scheduling and goal setting, which we believe
facilitates treatment retention and progress toward target
goals. Particularly in the early stages of treatment,
therapists try to work around client’s schedules and

generally make participation in treatment convenient.
We try to tolerate tardiness to sessions and early departure
from sessions, to be flexible in the time of day that
sessions are scheduled, and we even meet with clients
outside the office, if necessary. With especially difficult
clients, improvements in these areas become part of the
treatment plan.

Therapists must exhibit empathy and good listening
skills. They need to convey a sincere understanding
of the client’s situation and its inherent difficulties.
Throughout treatment, therapists avoid making value
judgments, and instead exhibit genuine empathy and
consideration for the difficult challenges that clients
face.

Last, CRA requires both therapists and patients to
develop an active, make-it-happen attitude throughout
treatment. Active problem solving is a routine part of
the therapeutic relationship. Within ethical boundaries,
therapists are committed to doing what it takes to facilitate
lifestyle changes on the part of clients. Therapists
take clients to appointments or job interviews. They
initiate recreational activities with clients and schedule
sessions at different times of day to accomplish specific
goals. They have clients make phone calls from their office,
and they search newspapers for job possibilities or
ideas for healthy recreational activities in which clients
might be able to participate. In summary, the motto of
CRA therapists is “We can make it happen,” and they
try their best to model that approach for patients.

CRA is delivered in twice-weekly 1- to 1.5-hour
therapy sessions during the initial 12 weeks and onceweekly
sessions of the same duration during the final
12 weeks of treatment. Sessions focus on the following
seven general topics, depending on the needs of the individual
client.

First, clients are instructed in how to recognize antecedents
and consequences of their cocaine use, that
is, how to functionally analyze their cocaine use. They
are also instructed in how to use that information to
reduce the probability of using cocaine. A twofold message
is conveyed to the client: (1) His/her cocaine use is
orderly behavior that is more likely to occur under certain
circumstances than others, and (2) by learning to
identify the circumstances that affect his/her cocaine
use, the client can develop and implement plans to reduce
the likelihood of future cocaine use. Our methods
for teaching functional analysis are based on the work
of Miller and Muñoz (e.g., 2005) and McCrady (Chapter
13, this volume), whose methods are used widely in
substance abuse treatment.


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

Using the form shown in Figure 14.1, we help clients

analyze instances of their own cocaine use. We explain

the following:

“A functional analysis allows you to identify the immediate
causes of your cocaine use. You have probably
noticed that in certain situations you use cocaine,
whereas in others you do not. The situations around
us can powerfully control cocaine use, particularly if
we are unaware of their influence.

“Some of the situations that can influence cocaine
use are people you are with, places you go, time of
day, the amount of money you have with you, how
much alcohol you have consumed, and how you are
feeling. The first step in understanding your cocaine
use is to identify the situations in which you are
likely to use. We call that identifying your ‘triggers.’
You will also want to identify consequences of your
use; that is, identify the immediate, usually positive
consequences (getting high, having fun), and the delayed,
often negative consequences (blowing your
money, unwanted sexual encounters, fights with your
spouse). As you identify triggers and consequences,
you will discover certain patterns to your cocaine
use that are important targets for intervention.”

Clients are assigned the task of analyzing at least

three recent episodes of cocaine use. Learning to ana


lyze one’s cocaine use is emphasized during initial

treatment sessions, but the exercise is used throughout
the treatment process to help clients understand and
modify any lapses to cocaine use, as well as to address
problems with cocaine craving.

In conjunction with functional analysis, clients are
taught self-management plans for using the information
revealed in the functional analyses to decrease
the chances of future cocaine use. Using the selfmanagement
planning sheet shown in Figure 14.2, clients
are counseled to restructure their daily activities to
minimize contact with known antecedents of cocaine
use, to find alternatives to the positive consequences of
cocaine use, and to make explicit the negative consequences
of cocaine use.

A key part of self-management planning that is implemented
with most clients is drug-refusal training.
Most cocaine abusers who are trying to quit cocaine
use continue to have contact, either planned or inadvertent,
with individuals who are still using. Turning down
cocaine or opportunities to go places where cocaine
is available is more difficult than most clients anticipate.
We approach this as a special case of assertiveness
training (e.g., McCrady, Chapter 13, this volume;
Meyers & Smith, 1995). The key components of effective
refusal are shown in Table 14.2. Therapists should
explain the rationale for drug-refusal skills training,
engage the client in a detailed discussion of the key elements
of effective refusal, assist the client in formulating
his/her own refusal style (incorporating the key ele-

ments), and role-play some scenes in which the client
is offered cocaine. The role-played situations should
be very specific and realistic for the client in terms of
people, times of day, location, and so forth. Client and
therapist should alternate roles, so that the former has
the opportunity to practice while receiving constructive
feedback, and the latter has the opportunity to model
effective refusal skills.

Second, all clients receive instruction in developing
a new social network that supports a healthier lifestyle
and getting involved with enjoyable recreational activities
that do not involve cocaine or other drug use.
Systematically developing and maintaining contacts

table 14.2. Components of effective
refusal

1. No should be the first thing you say.
2. Tell the person offering you drugs or asking you to go
out not to ask you now or in the future if you want to do
cocaine. Saying things like “maybe later,” “I have to get
home,” or “I’m on medication,” and so forth, just make it
likely that he or she will ask again.
3. Body language is important:
a. Making good eye contact is important; look directly
at the person when you answer.
b. Your expression and tone should clearly indicate that
you are serious.
4. Offer an alternative, if you want to do something else
with that person. Make sure that it is something that is
incompatible with cocaine use (taking your children for a
walk or to the park, going to work out, etc.).
5. Change the subject to a new topic of conversation.
with “safe” social networks and participation in ”safe”
recreational activities remain a high priority throughout
treatment for the vast majority of clients. Specific
treatment goals are set, and weekly progress on specific
goals is monitored (Principle 4, Table 14.1).

Clearly, plans for developing healthy social networks
and recreational activities must be individualized depending
on the circumstances, skills, and interests
of clients. For clients who are willing to participate,
self-help groups (Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics
Anonymous) can be an effective way to develop a new
network of associates that supports a sober lifestyle.
A clinic staff member often accompanies a client to
his/her first self-help meeting or two. By no means do
we focus exclusively on or mandate self-help involvement.
We assist clients with getting involved in a wide
variety of social groups that reinforce a healthy lifestyle
(e.g., church groups). Clinic staff members accompany
clients who are trying new, healthy activities.
Some clients wish to reinitiate activities in which they
engaged prior to becoming involved with cocaine use,
or have clear ideas about activities they would like to
pursue. We assist those clients in renewing or initiating
participation in those activities. Many others either
never engaged in recreation as adults without drug
involvement or are simply unable to identify any activities
they would currently like to pursue. We often
have these clients complete a leisure interest inventory
to prompt ideas about activities they might have liked
previously or otherwise want to explore. We encourage
clients to sample new activities even if they are unsure
whether they will find them enjoyable. As we describe


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

below, vouchers may be used to support costs of initiating
recreational and other activities that support a
healthy lifestyle.

Third, various other forms of individualized skills
training are provided, usually to address some specific
skills deficit that may influence directly or indirectly
a client’s risk for cocaine use (e.g., time management,
problem solving, assertiveness training, social skills
training, and mood management). For example, essential
to success with the self-management skills and
social/recreational goals discussed earlier is some level
of time management skills. All clients are given daily
planners to facilitate planning. Because clients may
lose or forget their planners, providing photocopies
to cover the next week of treatment is a good strategy.
Therapists provide the following rationale:

“This part of your treatment involves learning to plan,
schedule, and prioritize the events and activities in
your life. Solving your cocaine problem requires
making substantial lifestyle changes; it is important
to develop efficient ways to do this. Some patients
say they don’t like to plan—they like to be spontaneous.
But if they don’t find a way to schedule and
organize their lives, they often get overwhelmed and
don’t achieve their goals.”

With most clients, time management in some form is
worked on throughout treatment. The importance of
writing down a schedule of activities that help to promote
cocaine abstinence between therapy sessions is
emphasized in each session. Planning for “high-risk”
times is particularly important. Use of “to do” lists,
daily planning, and prioritizing activities is addressed.

As other examples of skills training, we implement
protocols on controlling depression (Lewinsohn,
Muñoz, Youngren, & Zeiss, 1986; Muñoz & Miranda,
2000) with those clients whose depression continues
after they discontinue cocaine use (see Principle
8, Table 14.1). We sometimes implement social skills
and relaxation training with individuals who report
social anxiety about meeting new people, dating, and
so forth (Rodebaugh, Holaway, & Heimberg, 2004).
Many clients report persistent problems with insomnia
following discontinuation of drug use. With them we
often implement a protocol based on those developed
by Morin (2004). We often work with clients regarding
money management. With many clients this might
simply involve helping them arrange direct deposit for
their paycheck, so that they are not tempted to use be


cause they have a large sum of cash on hand. For others,
this might involve a plan to get out of debt, which
can help to reduce stress. Because clients often have so
many problems that could benefit from our assistance,
we follow a rule of only treating those problems that we
feel directly or indirectly affect the probability of initial
and longer-term cocaine abstinence for individual
clients. Here we rely heavily on functional analysis and
other available information regarding the client’s cocaine
use. For problems that do not appear to be related
to cocaine use but warrant professional attention, we
generally make a referral. We work very hard to keep
treatment focused on resolving the problem of cocaine
use, and not being sidetracked by other pressing problems
that may have no direct or indirect effect on the
presenting problem of cocaine dependence.

Fourth, unemployed clients are offered Job Club,
which is an efficacious method to help chronically unemployed
individuals obtain employment (see the Job
Club manual; Azrin & Besalel, 1980). The majority of
people who seek treatment for cocaine dependence are
unemployed, so we offer this service to many of our
clients. We assist others in pursuing educational goals
or new career paths. A meaningful vocation is fundamental
to a healthy lifestyle, and we recommend goals
directed toward vocational enhancement for all clients.
Rules that we follow for several common types of vocational
problems are outlined in Table 14.3.

Fifth, clients with romantic partners who are not
drug abusers are offered behavioral couple therapy, an
intervention designed to teach couples positive communication
skills and how to negotiate reciprocal contracts
for desired changes in each other’s behavior. We
attempt to deliver relationship counseling across eight
sessions, with the first four sessions delivered across
consecutive weeks and the next four delivered on alternating
weeks. We introduce this aspect of therapy with
the following rationale:

“As you well know, an important area of your life that
is negatively affected by cocaine problems is your
relationship with your partner. Those close to the
person with the problem are typically most adversely
affected by the problem. Many partners of cocainedependent
individuals have tried many times to
help their mate to stop using. Strategies for trying
to help vary. Anger and frustration usually build up,
and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness arise.
Sometimes attempts to help are met with resentment
and anger from the partner with the problem.

••
Establish a more regular schedule.
••

continuing to work.
••
Modify the work environment to reduce risk of drug

use or improve working conditions.
••

“In this part of treatment, we focus on how cocaine
use has affected your relationship and how we
can work to increase the positive aspects of your relationship.
We also discuss ways that your partner
can assist you in achieving and maintaining abstinence.
We hope to be able to help you both deal more
effectively with this cocaine problem.

“We have found that where there are drug abuse
problems, there are usually communication problems.
Usually, we see communication that is filled
with anger, silence, apathy, or resentment, and many
times partners try to get their needs met outside the
relationship. By the time patients come to see us,
there is little, if any, enjoyment left in the relationship.”


The intervention involves a related series of exercises.
Partners independently rate their current level of
happiness across household responsibilities, child rearing,
social activities, money, communication, sex and
affection, academic progress, personal independence,

partner’s independence, general happiness. These ratings
are shared and discussed, then rerated weekly to
monitor progress. Next, a system of “daily reminders
to be nice” (i.e., express appreciation and affection toward
one’s spouse) is implemented. The obvious goal
is to get the partners to take the time to be positive
with each other. Each partner is expected to engage
in a daily practice of “nice” gestures toward his/her
spouse and to keep a daily compliance record of his/
her own behavior—not the spouse’s compliance. That
information is reviewed and shared during sessions.
After some level of positive interaction is established,
partners independently identify what a “perfect relationship”
would entail in terms of the key elements of
their relationship mentioned earlier—what that perfect
relationship would look like. Finally, the partners begin
to work on using positive communication skills to negotiate
for reciprocal changes in each other’s behavior
to move toward that “perfect relationship.” The terms
“positive” and “reciprocal” are fundamentally important
here. Requests are stated exclusively in positive
terms, and both members have to be willing to make
changes.

Sixth, HIV/AIDS education is provided to all clients
in the early stages of treatment, along with counseling
that addresses any specific needs or risk behavior of the
individual patient (Herrmann et al., 2013). We address
with all clients the potential for acquiring HIV/AIDS
from sharing injection equipment and through sexual
activity. This involves at least two sessions. First, clients
complete an HIV/AIDS knowledge test. They next
watch and discuss with their therapist a video on HIV/
AIDS. Points emphasized by therapists during the discussion
are shown in Table 14.4. Clients are also provided
HIV/AIDS prevention pamphlets and free condoms
(if desired). The HIV/AIDS knowledge test is
repeated, and any remaining errors are discussed and
resolved. Finally, clients are given information about
being tested for HIV antibodies and hepatitis B and C,
and are encouraged to get tested (Principle 12, Table
14.1). Those interested in testing are assisted by clinic
staff in scheduling an appointment.

Seventh, all who meet DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria
for alcohol dependence or report that alcohol use is
involved in their use of cocaine are offered disulfiram
therapy (see Principle 7, Table 14.1), which is an integral
part of the CRA treatment for alcoholism (Meyers
& Smith, 1995), and decreases alcohol and cocaine
use in clients who are dependent on both substances
(Carroll et al., 1998). Clients generally ingest a 250-mg


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

table 14.4. Points emphasized
in discussions of HiV/aids

1. The fastest-growing risk group for HIV/AIDS is made
up of people who use intravenous (IV) drugs and their
sexual partners. At the start of the epidemic, this group
made up just a small proportion of those getting infected,
but these numbers are increasing rapidly at the present
time. Not just gay men get infected!
2. Review the three ways that HIV is transmitted: (a)
through sexual contact with an infected person, (b)
through blood (as in needle sharing), and (c) from
infected mothers to their babies during pregnancy or at
the time of birth. Explain that the most efficient way for
HIV to be transmitted is through blood (blood contains
the highest concentration of the virus) and that sharing
needles (“works”) is an “easy” way for the virus to get
from the system of one person to that of another.
3. Emphasize the point that people who are infected with
HIV do not necessarily look sick and might not even
know they are infected. You cannot tell by looking at
someone whether that person has the virus.
4. If clients are currently using IV drugs, point out that
the only safe thing to do if they tend to share needles
is to use new needles or to clean them, if they are still
using. Review the steps necessary for appropriate syringe
cleaning.
5. Unprotected sexual intercourse with the exchange of
body fluids (blood, vaginal fluids, semen, preejaculatory
fluid) is also an efficient means of giving or receiving
the virus. Sex can be made safer by using latex condoms
for each and every sexual encounter (this includes oral,
vaginal, and anal sex).
6. Point out that alcohol and other drug use contribute to
risk because of (a) possible suppression of the immune
system, and (b) impaired judgment, which can lead to
increased risk taking (e.g., drug use, unsafe sex).
daily dose, observed by clinic staff on urinalysis test
days, and, when possible, by a significant other on the
other days. We encourage clients to sign a disulfiram
contract, shown in Figure 14.3. Disulfiram therapy is
only effective when implemented with procedures to
monitor compliance with the recommended dosage of
medication. We find that having staff monitor compliance
on days that clients report to the clinic works very
well. Having a significant other monitor compliance on
the other days works well if the appropriate person is
available to do so at the frequency needed. When that
is not possible, we sometimes adopt a practice of having
the client ingest a larger dose (500 mg) on days when

he/she reports to the clinic and skip dosing on the intervening
days.

Use of substances other than tobacco and caffeine
is discouraged as well in CRA therapy. Anyone who
meets DSM-IV-TR criteria for physical dependence on
opiates is referred to an adjoining service located within
our clinic for methadone or other opioid replacement
therapy (see Bickel, Amass, Higgins, Badger, & Esch,
1997). We recommend marijuana abstinence because
of the problems associated with its abuse, but we have
found no evidence that marijuana use or dependence
adversely affects treatment for cocaine dependence
(Budney, Higgins, & Wong, 1996). Importantly, we
never dismiss or refuse to treat a client due to other
drug use. We recommend cessation of tobacco use but
usually not during the course of treatment for cocaine
dependence. That practice may change as new research
begins to demonstrate that smoking cessation can be
successfully integrated into simultaneous treatment for
other substance abuse or dependence disorders.

Upon completion of the 24 weeks of treatment,
clients are encouraged to participate in 6 months of
aftercare in our clinic, which involves at least a oncemonthly
brief therapy session and a urine toxicology
screen. More frequent clinic contact is recommended if
therapist or client deem it necessary. These clinic visits
might be considered booster sessions that monitor progress
and address problems with cocaine use or other aspects
of the lifestyle changes initiated during treatment.
They also allow for a gradual rather than abrupt ending
of the client’s involvement with the clinic.

Voucher Program

As we noted earlier, the voucher program is a contingency
management intervention designed to increase
retention and abstinence. Many cocaine- and other
drug-dependent individuals arrive in treatment with
their lives in disarray. A reasonable assumption is
that some time will be needed to assist these individuals
in stabilizing and restructuring their lives, so that
naturalistic sources of reinforcement for abstinence can
exert some influence over their behavior. A protected
environment is an option, but the voucher program
is deemed a less expensive alternative. The goal is to
have this incentive program play a major role during
the initial 12 weeks of treatment, during which time
CRA therapy is ongoing as well. CRA assists clients
in restructuring their lifestyle, so that naturalistic rein

forcers are in place to sustain cocaine abstinence once
the vouchers are discontinued.

The voucher program is implemented in conjunction
with a rigorous urinalysis monitoring program (see
Principle 11, Table 14.1). We ask patients to sign an
Abstinence Contract (Figure 14.4), which describes the
voucher program and the urinalysis testing schedule.
Urine specimens are collected from all participants according
to a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule
during Weeks 1–12 and a Monday and Thursday schedule
during Weeks 13–24 of treatment. Specimens are
screened immediately via an onsite enzyme multiplied
immunoassay technique (EMIT, Syva Company, San
Jose, CA) to minimize delays in delivering reinforcement
for cocaine-negative specimens. To decrease the
likelihood of submitting bogus specimens, all specimen
collection is observed by a same-sex staff member, and
that staff member always reserves the right to request
another specimen if he/she has any concerns regarding
the integrity of a specimen. All specimens are screened
for benzoylecgonine, a cocaine metabolite, and each

week one randomly selected specimen also is screened
for the presence of other drugs of abuse. Breath alcohol
levels (BALs) are assessed at the time urine specimens
are collected. Failure to submit a scheduled specimen
is treated as a cocaine-positive result. Participants are
informed of their urinalysis and BAL results within
several minutes after submitting specimens.

Urine specimens collected during Weeks 1–12 that
test negative for benzoylecgonine earn points that are
recorded on vouchers and given to participants. Points
are worth the equivalent of $0.25 each. Money is never
provided directly to clients. Instead, points are used to
purchase retail items in the community. A staff member
makes all purchases. The first negative specimen
is worth 10 points at $0.25/point or $2.50. The value
of vouchers for each subsequent, consecutive negative
specimen increases by 5 points (second = 15 points,
third = 20 points, etc.). To further increase the likelihood
of continuous cocaine abstinence, the equivalent
of a $10 bonus is earned for each three, consecutive negative
specimens. A specimen that is cocaine-positive


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

This is an agreement between (the client) and

(the therapist) to help the client maintain abstinence from cocaine. By
this agreement I direct my therapist to establish a schedule for collecting urine specimens from me for 24 weeks. I will
provide urine samples three times per week on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule during the first 12 weeks of
treatment. During the second 12 weeks of treatment (Weeks 13–24), urine samples will be collected two times per week
on a Monday and Thursday schedule. A clinical staff member of my same sex will observe the urination. Half of each
urine sample will be submitted for immediate analysis and half will be saved at the clinic. Samples will be assayed for a
variety of drugs of abuse, among which are cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, marijuana, and sedatives.

Each specimen collection requires 3.0 ounces of urine. If the quantity is insufficient for analysis, that will be considered a
failure to provide a scheduled sample.

If I travel out of town due to an emergency, I will inform my therapist in advance of leaving. My therapist is authorized to
verify such absences with . If I require hospitalization, my therapist
will arrange to collect urine in the hospital. If I am sick and do not require hospitalization, I will still arrange to produce
scheduled urine specimens. If I have difficulty with transportation, or inclement weather makes it difficult to travel, I will
work out (with the assistance of the clinical staff) a way to get to the clinic for urine collection. On certain major holidays
the clinic will be closed. My therapist and I will mutually agree to altered urine schedules on these occasions.

If for appropriate medical reasons a prescription for one of the drugs which sometimes is abused is written, I will supply
my therapist with copies of that prescription. The appearance of that drug in the urine will not be counted as a relapse
to drug use. I hereby direct my therapist to communicate by mail or telephone with the prescribing physician or dentist
when my therapist deems that action to be appropriate.

Cocaine-Free Urines: For each cocaine-negative urine sample collected during Weeks 1–12 of treatment, points will be
earned. Each point is worth the monetary equivalent of $0.25, although they may not be exchanged directly for cash. A
voucher stating the earned point value will be presented to me following the collection of a cocaine-negative sample. This
voucher will specify the number of points earned for that day, as well as the cumulative points earned to date and their
monetary equivalent.

During the first 12 weeks of treatment, the first cocaine-free urine sample will earn 10 points, with each consecutive
cocaine-free sample collected thereafter earning an increment of 5 points above the previously earned amount. For
example, if 10 points are received on Wednesday for a cocaine-free urine sample, Friday’s cocaine-free sample will earn
15 points, Monday’s will earn 20, and so on. As an added incentive to remain abstinent from cocaine, a $10 bonus will
be earned for each week of three consecutive cocaine-negative urine samples collected at our clinic. Assuming there are
no cocaine-positive urine samples collected, the monetary equivalent of $997.50 can be earned during the first 12 weeks
of treatment. Since a major emphasis in our program is on lifestyle changes, primarily increasing activities that effectively
compete with drug use, the money earned on this incentive system must be used toward social or recreational goods
and activities agreed upon by my therapist and myself. A list of acceptable uses of vouchers has been developed for this
purpose and will be shared with me. During the second 12 weeks of treatment, the incentive program will be changed.
Rather than earning vouchers for cocaine-negative samples, I will be earning lottery tickets for clean samples.

For the entire 24 weeks of treatment, immediately after the urinalysis test results indicate that the urine sample is
cocaine-negative, the following will happen. The vouchers (Weeks 1–12) or lottery tickets (Weeks 13–24) will be
delivered. Following the presentation of each voucher, I will be asked if I would like to “purchase” any goods or services.
Vouchers may be used at any time during the 24-week program. Earned vouchers cannot be taken away from me under
any circumstances. The procedure for dealing with cocaine-positive urine samples is discussed below.

Cocaine-Positive Urines: All urine samples will be screened for drug use. A record will be kept of all drugs screened
positive, although this contract will be in effect for cocaine only. For each cocaine-positive urine sample collected I will

(continued)

Drug Use Disorders

not receive a voucher. In addition, the voucher earned for the next cocaine-free urine sample will be reset to 10. To
reset the voucher value to where it was prior to the cocaine “slip,” I must provide five consecutive cocaine-free samples.
The fifth “clean” sample will then earn me the same monetary equivalent as that earned for the sample preceding the
cocaine-positive one, and the system outlined earlier will continue to be in effect (i.e., each clean sample will earn 5
points more than the previous one).

Failure to Provide a Urine Sample: Failure to provide a urine sample on the designated date (without prior approval of
my therapist) will be treated as a cocaine-positive sample and the procedures noted earlier will be in effect. Although
clinic staff will make an attempt to obtain the sample by coming to my home (with my permission, of course), cocainenegative
urine samples collected in this manner will not earn voucher points, nor will they reset my voucher value to 10.
In effect, cocaine-negative samples collected outside of our clinic (except in the case of hospitalization) are “neutral.” On
the other hand, if clinic staff obtain a sample from me outside of the clinic, and the sample is cocaine-positive, it will be
treated in the manner outlined above for cocaine-positive urine samples.

My signature below acknowledges that I agree to the urinalysis monitoring system outlined above. This system has been
carefully explained to me, and I understand the outcome of providing both cocaine-negative and cocaine-positive urine
samples while I am a client at the clinic.

or failure to submit a scheduled specimen resets the
value of vouchers back to the initial $2.50, from which
they can escalate again according to the same schedule.
Submission of five consecutive cocaine-negative
specimens following submission of a positive specimen
returns the value of points to where they were prior to
the reset. Points cannot be lost once they are earned.

Patients and therapists jointly select retail items to be
purchased with points. The items commonly obtained
are quite diverse, including YMCA passes, continuing
education materials, fishing licenses, gift certificates to
local restaurants, hobby materials, and so forth. Therapists
retain veto power over all purchases. Purchases
are only approved if therapists deem them to be in concert
with individual treatment goals of increasing drugfree,
healthy activities.

The voucher program is discontinued at the end of
Week 12. During Weeks 13–24, participants receive a
single $1.00 Vermont State Lottery ticket per cocainenegative
urinalysis test. Across the 24 weeks of treatment,
patients can earn a maximum of $997.50 in
vouchers during Weeks 1–12 and $24 in lottery tickets
during Weeks 13–24. No material incentives are
delivered during the recommended 6-month aftercare

period. There is strong evidence that vouchers worth
only several hundred dollars over the 12-week course
of treatment are efficacious, although the magnitude of
the treatment effect decreases significantly as the size
of the incentive decreases (Lussier et al., 2006).

Getting Therapy Under Way

The therapist has many tasks to accomplish during
the first two sessions (Week 1) of treatment, in addition
to simply getting to know the client and developing
rapport. These sessions are critical to enhancing
motivation and setting the tone for treatment. Hence,
we provide detailed descriptions of the specific tasks to
accomplish during initial therapy sessions.

As discussed earlier, urinalysis and cocaine use test
results are the first areas addressed. By starting the session
with a direct assessment of cocaine use, the therapist
provides a clear message that the focus of this treatment
is the cocaine use disorder.

After a discussion of cocaine use and voucher earnings,
the therapist should make sure that the client has
completed all the intake materials. Here the therapist
can also answer any new questions the client may have.


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

If practical needs, such as housing, transportation,
or child care, are issues for treatment attendance, these
needs should be a primary focus of the first session.
Therapists should do everything possible to assist clients
in finding solutions to these problems.

The therapist should discuss alternative activities or
strategies for coping with high-risk situations for cocaine
use, especially situations that are likely to arise
during the upcoming week. As discussed earlier, having
the client use appointment books or photocopies
provided by the clinic is very helpful for scheduling
alternative plans or activities. The next session should
also be scheduled, and the client should record the day
and time in the appointment book.

The therapist should begin to formulate a comprehensive
treatment plan with specific goals and methods.
He/she might introduce this task in the following
way:

“A treatment plan will allow us to write down the
things you and I think are important to accomplish
and how we plan to go about trying to accomplish
them. We will use the plan to keep us focused on the
task at hand—that is, making lifestyle changes that
will help you stop using cocaine and other drugs, and
also increase your satisfaction with other important
areas of your life. The treatment plan will be developed
through a cooperative effort between you and
me. It is important that you think the goals we set
are important and will help you achieve what you
want in life. My job in this process is to assist you in
coming up with meaningful, effective goals, and to
offer advice based on my knowledge and experience
with treating persons with cocaine and other drug
problems.”

The therapist should then present ideas about which
areas of the client’s life need changes. For each suggested
change, it is important that the therapist provide
a rationale that draws from the information collected
from the client, as well as from research findings and
clinical experience. An open discussion and exchange
of ideas should then follow.

If the client is reluctant to participate, the therapist
should ask for his/her thoughts on each potential area
for change. The therapist can facilitate client participation
with questions such as “What do you think?”;
“Do you have any thoughts on this?”; “Does this make
sense to you?”; “Do you think this is important?”;
and “Is this type of change possible?” It is important

for therapist and client to agree on which areas of life
present problems and should be changed. If a client disagrees
with the therapist’s opinion, those areas should
be dropped and discussed later in treatment if they continue
to pose problems.

After the areas for change are agreed upon, therapist
and client should discuss each one. Therapists should
use active listening skills (reflection and empathy) and
try to keep the focus on the specific areas. They should
inform clients that they will focus on these problem
areas in each session. Progress and problems are openly
discussed, and additions or deletions to the plan are
decided upon by therapist and client together.

Next, therapist and client together decide the order
in which these problem areas should be addressed, always
remembering that to increase cocaine abstinence
is the primary goal. Mutual agreement is important,
and a therapist may need to compromise to achieve
such agreement.

Specific goals should then be set for each problem
area. It is important that the therapist provide a rationale
for setting specific goals:

“Setting specific goals is important. They will help us
stay focused on the primary changes we agreed are
important for stopping your drug use and achieving
a more satisfying life without drugs. Specific goals
also provide a way to measure progress. This can be
very important because many times progress can be
slow. You may feel you are getting nowhere. In reality,
you may be progressing in making changes, but
you don’t feel much different. Information about specific
goals will help us both see more clearly whether
we are heading in the right direction, even if the
progress is slow.

“This information can also show when you are not
progressing as we planned and can lead us to either
reconsider the goal or find other ways to meet the
goal. Keeping track of progress on specific goals
also provides us with a reminder to reward or praise
you for the hard work you are doing. Lifestyle changes
are often difficult to make. We would also like you
to learn to pat yourself on the back and take credit if
you are doing well.”

These goals should be quantifiable, so that progress
can be graphed. Targets for change should be set in the
priority areas listed in the treatment plan and categorized
as primary or secondary behavior change goals.
Examples of typical goals are as follows:


Drug Use Disorders

••
Five job contacts per week or making an appointment
for vocational rehabilitation.
••
Engaging in three recreational activities each
week during high-risk times.
••
Spending 4 hours each week engaging in fun ac


tivities with a family member or friend.
••
Attending class one night each week.
••
Doing 2 hours of homework toward obtaining a

general equivalency diploma (GED).

••
Planning and doing activities with a person who
does not use drugs on nights when one typically
used cocaine.

A therapist and client should mutually decide on
these goals. Basic principles of effective goal setting
should be followed:

••
Set relatively low goals at first, so that the client
can experience success early.

••
Thoroughly analyze all possible barriers to achieving
selected goals, so that unrealistic goals are
avoided.

••
Make sure that the client understands how a goal
relates to the overall treatment plan.

It is essential to maximize the probability that the
client will carry through and achieve the desired behavior
change. The therapist’s responsibility is to use
the appropriate counseling style and behavioral procedures
to increase the probability of compliance with a
targeted behavior.

The treatment plan should be updated regularly because
treatment planning is a process of constant reevaluation,
assessment, and change based on objective
indices of progress (Principle 4, Table 14.1). The client
and therapist together should review, discuss, and assess
the treatment plan frequently as goals are achieved
or as interventions fail, or as new information becomes
available. These changes should also be reviewed at the
regular clinical supervision meeting.

Implementing the treatment plan, monitoring progress,
and modifying and updating the treatment plan
according to client needs, progress, and problems are
the “meat” of the remainder of treatment.

Clinical Supervision

Doctorate-level psychologists who have expertise in
behavioral psychology and substance abuse treatment
provide supervision in our clinic. Supervisors provide

significant input into treatment plans and selection of
targets for behavior change. The supervisor provides
guidance about how to monitor progress.

Supervision is provided weekly in sessions that usually
last 2–3 hours, during which all cases are reviewed.
Therapists update the supervisor and other clinic therapists
on each patient’s progress based on specific treatment
goals and whether progress has been made since
the last supervision meeting. Progress is presented
graphically for all goals.

A supervisor’s style in this model should include a
balance of support, feedback, problem solving, and instruction.
Considering that CRA plus vouchers requires
an active therapeutic approach that can be effortful, the
supervisor must serve as a stable source of support, encouragement,
and direction in implementing the treatment
plan.

We follow a fixed protocol in reviewing cases. First,
review begins with examination of a graph of the patient’s
cocaine urinalysis results from the start of treatment.
Second, we review use of alcohol or any other
drugs that are being targeted for change. Then we review
attendance at therapy sessions, primary goals for
lifestyle changes, and secondary goals for the same.
Once those treatment targets have been reviewed and
modified as necessary, any recent crises or relevant
clinical issues, such as suicidal ideation or newly identified
problem behaviors, are discussed.

At any point in treatment, treatment goals and targets
may be changed. Changes in goals may be precipitated
by achievement of prior goals, failure to make any
progress toward a specific goal, and clear indication
that the goal is not functionally related to cocaine use.

iMPleMeNtiNG the cra Plus vouchers
treatMeNt: a case stuDy

In this section we review the case of a client treated in
our clinic with the CRA plus vouchers treatment. We
chose this case because it illustrates well a number of
different aspects of using this treatment approach. Outcome
was quite good but certainly not perfect, which is
to be expected with this population. The case also illustrates
the multifaceted problems with which cocainedependent
clients present.

Bill, a 24-year-old, single (never married), European
American male, was self-referred to the clinic for
help with problems with cocaine use. He had been living
with a friend, who also used cocaine, until several


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

weeks prior to the intake interview, when Bill moved
in with his parents. He had a 5-year-old daughter who
lived with an estranged romantic partner. The client
currently was without legal visitation rights with his
daughter because of her mother’s concerns over Bill’s
record of drug use.

Bill, a high school graduate, had been employed
full-time in a retail business for the past 3 years. He
reported that most of the individuals with whom he associated
were drug abusers. Bill reported a history of
healthy social and recreational activities, including golf
and skiing, but he had not engaged in those activities
with regularity for a number of years.

He had a history of involvement with the criminal
justice system, with one conviction for a weapons offense.
Bill was incarcerated for 3 months related to that
charge but was not under criminal justice supervision at
the time he sought treatment.

Presenting Complaint

Bill reported being on a 3-day binge prior to intake and
wanted help with stopping cocaine use. He reported
numerous prior attempts to stop on his own, but with
minimal success. Bill reported being “fed up” with
how he felt after bingeing episodes of cocaine use and
was concerned about the financial problems his cocaine
use caused. He also expressed serious concerns that
his drug use and related lifestyle had resulted in the
strained relationship with his child and ex-girlfriend
that interfered with his getting visitation privileges.

Assessment

Cocaine Use

Bill met DSM-IV-TR criteria for cocaine dependence.
He reported a 6-year history of intranasal cocaine use.
In his most recent use, 7 days prior to intake, Bill used

10.5 grams of cocaine at home with friends, reporting
that this was his typical pattern of use. At intake, Bill
reported three episodes of cocaine use during the prior
30 days, with each episode lasting approximately 48
hours, usually during weekends. He typically used cocaine
with friends at bars or at friends’ houses.
His cocaine use was often preceded by spending
time in bars or working excessive hours, or by certain
moods that included feeling bored, depressed, anxious,
or upset. Bill reported a number of serious consequences
as a result of his cocaine use, including physical and

financial problems; a relationship breakup; and psychiatric
symptoms such as depression, anxiety, suicidal
ideation, and violent impulses.

Other Drug Use

Bill’s first use of alcohol was at age 16. He reported
a pattern of weekly binge drinking, during which he
would ingest 13–15 shots of hard liquor. He reported
drinking 5 days out of the past 30 days. Bill’s first use
of cannabis was at age 14. He reported 10 years of daily
use and having used cannabis on 30 of the prior 30
days. He reported limited prior use of amphetamines
and hallucinogens but no regular or current use of those
substances. A regular cigarette smoker, Bill smoked approximately
20 cigarettes per day. Bill reported no previous
treatment episodes for substance abuse.

Bill also met DSM-IV-TR criteria for alcohol, cannabis,
and nicotine dependence.

Other Psychiatric Problems

Bill reported a history of depression and suicidal ideation.
He also noted problems with anger management,
which he agreed had been a significant problem for
him, and for which he had previously received counseling.
His BDI score was 23 at intake (Beck, Ward,
Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961), but he reported
no suicidal ideation.

Motivation to Change

Bill’s score on the SOCRATES at intake indicated a
strong commitment to cocaine abstinence. He expressed
a moderate commitment to alcohol abstinence
but agreed to disulfiram therapy for the duration of
treatment. He noted plans to return to social drinking
after completion of treatment. He was uninterested in
discontinuing marijuana use, which he did not consider
a problem, and was not currently interested in discontinuing
cigarette smoking.

Conceptualization of the Case

Bill worked long hours, sometimes holding several jobs
simultaneously. That practice left little time for other
types of activities and, as might be expected, he reported
minimal involvement in any form of ongoing recreational
activities. Aside from work, then, there were
few alternative sources of reinforcement to compete


Drug Use Disorders

with the reinforcing effects of Bill’s cocaine and other
drug use. These situations typically snowball, so that
cocaine and related drug abuse monopolize more and
more the person’s activities. In this case, Bill’s practices
of working long hours, frequenting bars, and using
drugs, and his difficulties with anger management,
were sufficient to destroy his relationship with his romantic
partner, thereby greatly restricting his time with
his daughter. Losing those relationships further eliminated
any competing sources of reinforcement and also
freed up additional time and resources to allocate to the
bar and cocaine use scenes. While we deemed Bill’s
long work hours to have likely increased his vulnerability
to the drug-abusing lifestyle, his full-time employment
also likely provided some protection against
cocaine gaining even greater control over his behavior.
Full-time employment is a positive prognostic variable
with this and other treatments for cocaine dependence,
as is the use of an intranasal route of cocaine administration,
which was Bill’s preferred route.

Treatment Plan

Cocaine abstinence was the first priority in Bill’s treatment
plan and is always the main focus in this treatment
approach. Next, we recommended alcohol abstinence
due to the close relationship between Bill’s cocaine and
alcohol use. As mentioned earlier, Bill was unwilling to
change his use of marijuana despite the rationales we
provided regarding both the benefits of doing so and
potential adverse consequences of continuing to smoke.
Our clinical approach was to look for opportunities
during the course of treatment to reinforce any movement
toward reducing or discontinuing marijuana use,
but not to make Bill’s reluctance to change this problem
behavior a point of contention. Reestablishing a regular
pattern of involvement in healthy recreational activities,
especially activities that might substitute for cocaine
and alcohol use on weekends, was a high-priority
goal. The therapist provided the following rationale to
Bill as to why we deemed participation in these activities
to be a high priority:

tHeraPist: Many times, when cocaine or other drugs
become a regular part of someone’s life, they stop
doing many of the nondrug activities they used to
enjoy. That seems to be true in your case. You used
to do lots of healthy recreational activities, but after
getting into cocaine use you got away from those
other activities.

Bill: No doubt. It’s funny, too, because I’m not even
sure how that happened. Just gradually got off into
different things. Never really stopped liking the
other stuff. Just seems like I sort of drifted away
from them.

tHeraPist: That’s a pretty common report. You have
a lot going for you though, Bill. You have a history
of doing these healthier activities and having liked
them. That’s a strength that you’ll be able to build
upon during treatment.

Bill: Good, haven’t felt like I’ve had too many strengths
lately. But how do we do this? What’s the connection
to my cocaine use?

tHeraPist: Healthy social and recreational activities
are important in people’s lives. They provide something
positive to look forward to after work, a way to
decrease boredom and to feel healthy, and a chance
to be with people you like. Such activities can play
an important part in becoming and staying cocaine
free. When you give up using drugs, you have to do
something else during the times you used to use. If
the things you do are not satisfying or enjoyable, or
you don’t do anything but sit around and feel lonely
or bored, you are more likely to use drugs. That is
why we have a specific treatment component to assist
you in developing a regular schedule of healthy
social and recreational activities.

Bill: Yeah, that could be important for me. I don’t find
it easy to hang out around the house. I get bored,
pretty antsy.

tHeraPist: OK, lets go right to work on these now. We
gave you a daily planner. Lets plan some activities
to do between today and your next clinic visit. We
really have to think carefully about Friday night because
that’s a high-risk night for you. We’ll be doing
a lot of this throughout therapy.

Another high priority was to assist Bill in finding
an alternative source of employment that would permit
him to have a more reasonable work schedule, and that
paid well enough that he would not feel compelled to
hold several jobs simultaneously. To increase further
Bill’s involvement in activities that were incompatible
with the cocaine-using lifestyle, we assisted Bill in
petitioning for visitation privileges with his daughter.
Regarding other psychiatric problems, we decided to
monitor Bill’s BDI scores weekly to see whether they
followed the precipitous decline that typically occurs


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

with cocaine-dependent patients within a couple of
weeks of entering treatment. Because anger management
had been a problem for Bill previously in dealing
with his estranged partner, and because he would
have to interact with her if he was to obtain visitation
privileges, we deemed anger-management treatment
appropriate.

Below we outline the progress made in implementing
this treatment plan.

Cocaine Abstinence

Contingent vouchers, as the primary intervention for
promoting initial abstinence, were made available to
Bill according to our standard 12-week protocol. Functional
analysis was also implemented with Bill during
Sessions 1 and 2. Circumstances that increased the
likelihood that Bill would use were being at a bar or
at certain friends’ houses, using alcohol, ending a particularly
long work week, and experiencing depression
or boredom. He identified going to the movies or to a

safe friend’s house, hunting, fishing, and skiing as circumstances
that decreased his likelihood of using. That
information was updated and used throughout Bill’s
course of treatment in self-management planning and
in planning for social and recreational activities.

Shown in Figure 14.5 is a cumulative record of Bill’s
cocaine use and urinalysis results during the 24-week
treatment. His only instance of use occurred 7 weeks
into treatment. Bill reported being surprised by the results
and said that he had smoked marijuana with several
friends, and that perhaps some cocaine had been
in the pipe.

tHeraPist: Hi, Bill. How have things been going?

Bill: Pretty good.

tHeraPist: Look, the lab just called with your urinalysis
results. You’re positive for cocaine.

Bill: No way. That can’t be right. Wow, I haven’t used

cocaine. Didn’t do much of anything over the week


end.

tests (X axis) conducted during 24 weeks of treatment.


Drug Use Disorders

tHeraPist: That’s how the machine read the sample.
Let’s talk more specifically about what you did over
the weekend. Let’s review what did you on each of
the days, and perhaps that will give us some insights
into what might be going on.

Bill: Just shut down the shop around midnight and
went home and went to bed on Friday night. I worked
Saturday morning. After I got off work, I hung out
with some friends for a while.

tHeraPist: No gym like you planned?

Bill: Nah. Should have, but got sidetracked by running
into some buddies I hadn’t seen in a while.

tHeraPist: Any of those guys use cocaine?

Bill: Yeah, one does, but he knows I’m in treatment.
I used to use cocaine with him. He doesn’t do any
cocaine around me now, though.

tHeraPist: What exactly did you guys do?

Bill: Just hung out at this one buddy’s house, played
video games, and watched some television. We
smoked a couple of bowls of pot. You know, I’m still
smoking. Could be that the bowl we used had been
used to smoke cocaine in recently. Bet that was it.

tHeraPist: Could be. What is pretty clear is that by
getting off track of what you had planned, you increased
your vulnerability for problems.

Bill: Yeah, I agree. I’m not sure I understand why I did
that. I’ve been doing really well with sticking with
my plans even when I run into the guys. Was supposed
to get a ride to the gym from my mom, but
it was a nice day, so I told her I’d walk. Saw these
dudes, started talking, and just sort of bagged my
plans for the gym.

tHeraPist: I have no doubt about that. You’ve been
doing a great job up to now with sticking with your
plans. Bill, you’ve been doing terrific with abstaining
from cocaine. That is not easy to do and you deserve
a tremendous amount of credit for all of the
work you’ve been doing.

Bill: Shoot, kind of blew it here.

tHeraPist: Important thing is to try to learn from
what happened. As you know, my recommendation
from the start of treatment has been to abstain from
marijuana use. Marijuana has its own problems,
plus it puts you into contact with other drug abusers,
sometimes including cocaine users.

Bill: I agree with that to some extent, but I don’t re


ally think that marijuana was the problem here. I’ve
been smoking regularly since starting treatment and
have been able to stay away from cocaine. What is
different here is that I hung out all day instead of
sticking with my plan to go to the gym. That’s where
I screwed up. That’s the big difference from what I
had been doing on the other weekends.

tHeraPist: Good job with your analysis. Keep in mind
though, if you weren’t still smoking, you wouldn’t
have had any need to use a pipe—yours or theirs.
Nevertheless, your point is well taken regarding
what you did differently this weekend compared to
the others since you’ve been in treatment. Sticking
with the plans for alternative activities rather than
just hanging out has really been working for you. I
agree with you about that. The most important thing
to do here is to learn from this situation and move on.
What do you think you need to do to be sure you’ll
be cocaine-negative on Wednesday?

Bill: Well, I guess just keep doing what I’ve been
doing—sticking to my plans: work, visit Mom, and
I have a date tomorrow night. I’m scheduled to go
to the gym tonight, and I’m definitely sticking with
that. Being clean next time won’t be a problem.

tHeraPist: How about minimizing your contact with
any drug users, especially people you’ve used cocaine
with in the past? We could even role-play how
you might tell the guys how you have to be going, in
case you run into them again.

Bill: I guess I could do that. I don’t see most of those
guys that often anyway. Yeah, sure.

tHeraPist: Good. As you know, we have to go by the
urinalysis results. So you won’t earn a voucher today
and their value gets reset back to the original low
value because of today’s positive result. However, if
you can get back on track with providing negative
samples, five consecutive negatives mean that the
value of the vouchers get reset back to where they
were before today’s positive.

Bill: That’s fair enough.

Our experience is that there is little need to quibble
over a client’s denial of a single instance of cocaine use.
If the client has resumed regular cocaine use, a pattern
of positives will soon emerge. Instead, the therapist
reviewed with Bill the risks of continuing to smoke
marijuana while working on maintaining cocaine abstinence
(continuing contact with drug-using friends,


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

high-risk places, using marijuana rather than other
possible activities or way to relax). They also reviewed
the importance of sticking with planned activities and
prepared to role-play some social skills that Bill could
use to resist changing his plans should he run into drugusing
friends again. Bill was very insightful about how
he had deviated from what had been working for him
up to this point—planning activities and sticking to the
plans—and the therapist reinforced his analysis. The
matter of denying cocaine use was not pursued further.
Bill and the therapist carried on with implementing the
treatment plan, with the few modifications mentioned.
There were no further instances of cocaine use during
Bill’s 24 weeks of treatment. His record of documented
cocaine abstinence was excellent.

Alcohol Abstinence

During the first session, the therapist discussed with
Bill the rationale for disulfiram therapy:

tHeraPist: Bill, we want to go over a few reasons for
you to give disulfiram therapy and alcohol abstinence
a try. First, your history indicates that if you
drink, you are more likely to use cocaine. You’re not
alone in that regard. The scientific evidence is very
clear that for many individuals who seek treatment
for cocaine dependence, alcohol and cocaine use are
closely linked.

Bill: I don’t want to get drunk any more. What about
just a few drinks? Is that a problem, too?

tHeraPist: Use of even modest doses of alcohol, even
just a few drinks, can significantly decrease your
chances of successfully abstaining from cocaine use.
Our experience, and the experience in other clinics
around the country, is that you can make greater
progress with cocaine abstinence by using disulfiram
and abstaining from alcohol use than if you
continue to drink.

Bill: How long are you suggesting I take the medicine?
Are you saying I can never drink again?

tHeraPist: I’m not saying that you’ll have to take this
medicine forever or for years, or anything of that nature,
or even that you can never go back to drinking.
We can cross those bridges a ways down the road.
But for now, if you want to give yourself the best
chance to succeed with quitting cocaine, I recommend
that you give disulfiram therapy a sincere try.

Bill: I’m not sure how much of a problem drinking is
for me. I know it’s caused some problems, but I’m
just not so sure.

tHeraPist: Bill, the second thing I wanted to emphasize
is that you also reported a history of depression
and suicidal ideation. Substance use, particularly alcohol
use, is a depressant and can worsen depressive
symptoms and suicide risk. A period of abstinence
may help a good deal with those problems. And still
another point to consider is that agreeing to disulfiram
therapy represents a concrete demonstration of
your commitment to drug abstinence and substantial
lifestyle changes. This would be helpful in general,
but it could also be helpful in your pursuit of visitation
privileges with your daughter.

Bill: Hey, I’m looking to make some progress here.
When I’ve tried to quit cocaine on my own, it’s not
worked for beans. Maybe it’s because I kept drinking,
I’m not sure. I can’t continue like this. How
about I take the medicine during treatment? That’s
a pretty good commitment. What did you say, treatment
is for 24 weeks? Lets say I’ll go on the medicine
for that amount of time.

Bill agreed to disulfiram therapy for the duration of
treatment. A schedule was set up for Bill to ingest a
250-mg dose three times per week, under the observation
of clinic staff, and to ingest the same dose under
the observation of his father at home on alternating
days.

In addition to disulfiram therapy, the therapist
worked with Bill on a functional analysis of his alcohol
use, similar to the preceding process for cocaine.
They reviewed specific circumstances under which Bill
was more likely or less likely to drink, and listed the
negative consequences he had previously experienced
from his alcohol use. The therapist and Bill then began
to develop a plan for finding alternative ways to relax
that did not involve the bar or drinking, as well as to
rehearse how to refuse alcohol when it was offered, and
how to identify times that Bill might be tempted to have
a drink.

Bill was compliant with disulfiram therapy throughout
treatment. He reported only one instance of alcohol
use while on disulfiram therapy, when he did not take
the medication on a Sunday morning and drank two
beers at home that afternoon. On Monday, the therapist
did a functional analysis with Bill to identify what set


Drug Use Disorders

up the occasion for him to drink, and what had happened
with his father serving as disulfiram assurance
monitor. The therapist and Bill reviewed again his history
of alcohol use and the negative consequences he
had experienced in the past. Bill recommitted to alcohol
abstinence and resumed disulfiram therapy.

When the end of the 24-week treatment approached
(Week 23), Bill expressed a desire to “be able to have a
drink if he wanted” and asked to discontinue disulfiram
therapy, as planned. The therapist expressed his concerns
about jeopardizing the substantial progress Bill
had made.

tHeraPist: So you’re due to end disulfiram therapy
this week?

Bill: Yep, stuck to it like I promised, but now I’d like to
be able to drink if I want to, like having a beer after
work to relax. Nothing major.

tHeraPist: Bill, you’ve done really well so far with
this current plan. Most folks are not as successful as
you’ve been in stopping cocaine use.

Bill: Oh, I agree. I just feel like I’ve done really well in
treatment and now that it’s almost over, I’d like to be
able to have that choice to drink if I want to.

tHeraPist: How risky do you think going off disulfiram
is going to be for you in terms of continuing
your success with abstaining from cocaine?

Bill: I really don’t think it’s going to be a problem. I’m
feeling pretty confident about that.

tHeraPist: Bill, that’s great. That sort of confidence is
important to success. Let’s talk about some specifics
though. Remember, your alcohol history is still with
you. In the past you’ve had periods of binge drinking
combined with cocaine use. What’s going to be different
now from that past history?

Bill: Well, first of all, I don’t plan on drinking like I
used to. I’m not looking to get drunk. I’m not even
sure I want to drink very often. Also, I’m not going
to drink in bars. That’s how I’ve gotten into trouble
in the past. And I’m not going to drink with the same
old crowd. I just want to know that if I go out to dinner
on a date or something and want to have a drink,
I can do that.

tHeraPist: You’ve given this careful consideration,
which is good. Those kind of plans are important to
continuing your success. Let’s talk a bit more about
how you can reduce your risk as much as possible

if you’re going to resume drinking. By that, I mean
how often you drink, how much you drink per occasion,
where and with whom you drink—more or
less, anything you can do to protect yourself from
excessive drinking and, subsequently, cocaine use.
Does this sound reasonable to you?

Bill: Yeah, sure, that sounds really good.

At this time, the therapist began the clinic’s controlled
drinking protocol (see Miller & Muñoz, 2005).
Our primary clinical recommendation was abstinence,
but Bill was not going to follow that recommendation.
Hence, we felt that attempting systematically to provide
him with some skills to decrease the likelihood of abusive
or harmful drinking was indicated. The Miller and
Muñoz approach aims to teach skills that enable the
client to drink in a controlled manner. Some of these
skills are the same as those involved with cocaine use,
including functional analysis to identify the circumstances
(location, people, times, feeling states) associated
with heavy drinking. Others are specific to alcohol
consumption (e.g., providing information about the alcohol
content of common drinks, relationship between
drinks consumed, body weight, and the blood alcohol
curve). Bill and the therapist worked through some of
the core elements of the controlled-drinking protocol
during the final week of treatment, then covered the
remaining parts during aftercare. Bill reported one instance
of alcohol use during he final week of treatment.
He had only two drinks and did not use cocaine. As we
note below, Bill also has reported little drinking during
posttreatment follow-up.

Other Drug Use

Bill continued the same pattern of marijuana use that
he reported in the intake interview. He repeatedly asserted
that marijuana use was not interfering with his
other treatment goals. In turn, the therapist provided
rationales for stopping or reducing marijuana use on
numerous occasions but was not successful in initiating
abstinence.

Recreational Activities

During the first several sessions, the therapist and Bill
discussed the importance of developing new recreational
activities. They decided on a goal of participating
in four of these activities per week, as well as a


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

plan to sample some new activities in the company of
clinic staff. The therapist reminded Bill that the vouchers
he would be earning during treatment for cocaine
abstinence could be used to help pay for these activities.


During treatment, Bill consistently met his goal of
four recreational activities per week. Those activities
included movies, hunting, golf, and dinners at local
restaurants. He used his vouchers to buy tickets to a
performance at a local theater, greens fees to play golf,
a gym membership, hunting and fishing licenses, and
gift certificates to a local restaurant for dinner with a
new girlfriend.

Family/Social Support

During the first few sessions, the therapist discussed
with Bill the need to expand his social network to include
family, friends, and other social contacts with
non-drug-using people. Bill expressed a desire for increased
contact with his daughter. Toward that end, Bill
and his therapist completed a task analysis identifying
the sequence of steps that would have to be taken to try
to attain visitation privileges. These included requesting
and completing legal forms from the court, the therapist
helping Bill to discuss his wishes appropriately
with his former partner, role plays in preparation for the
court date, and accompanying Bill to court.

Bill succeeded in obtaining visitation privileges. His
goal then became twice-weekly contact with his daughter,
which he maintained consistently throughout the
remainder of treatment.

Regarding other types of social support, Bill also
increased contact with a couple of safe friends during
the course of treatment. He also was able to meet several
women through his new employment (discussed
below), one of whom he began dating regularly.

Employment/Education

Bill came to treatment with a history of full-time employment,
which is a good prognostic indicator in itself.
However, his job upon entering treatment did not pay
well and involved being around drinking. He expressed
a desire to find a job that offered better pay, thereby allowing
him to work fewer hours per week and to spend
more time with his daughter, and to be at reduced risk
for alcohol use. Therefore, Bill began participating in
Job Club, coming to the clinic three times per week to

go through local employment classifieds, complete a resume
and cover letters with the help of staff, fill out job
applications, and rehearse for job interviews. Bill successfully
obtained a better paying job with fewer risks
for alcohol use. Thereafter, his vocational goal was to
focus on avoiding excessive hours.

Bill also expressed concern regarding the extensive
debt he had accumulated during this prolonged cocaine
use. The therapist began the clinic’s money management
protocol, including developing a budget for repayment
of outstanding loans and skills for managing
personal finances. Bill opened a savings account at a
nearby bank and arranged for direct deposit of his paychecks.
He used the phone in his therapist’s office to
arrange payback plans with several debtors. Bill consistently
made payments on his debt throughout treatment,
which the therapist graphed weekly and, by the
end of treatment, had eliminated all back debt and was
now paying current bills.

Bill had a long-term vocational goal of eventually
opening his own retail business. He and his therapist
completed a preliminary task analysis (see Sulzer-
Azaroff & Meyer, 1991) related to that goal. They
agreed that taking accounting and computer courses
would be a good start. The therapist helped Bill collect
information from the local community college on the
classes being offered. Bill requested financial aid applications
from the community college for assistance
with tuition, which his therapist helped him complete.

Psychiatric Monitoring

Recall that Bill’s BDI score at intake was 23. His BDI
score had dropped precipitously by the second week of
treatment, and reached a score of 2 by the end of treatment.


Bill and his therapist worked through an anger management
protocol for substance abusers (Monti, Kadden,
Rohsenow, Cooney, & Abrams, 2002) that helped
Bill identify situations that would likely make him
angry, develop coping skills to deal better with those
triggers, and role-play those coping skills to gain proficiency.
The therapist had Bill document when potential
anger-provoking situations arose outside of the clinic
and how he handled them. The therapist reviewed that
information weekly, provided social reinforcement for
those situations that were handled well, and problemsolved
and role-played alternatives when Bill needed
assistance.


Drug Use Disorders

Summary of Treatment Progress

Bill made substantial progress toward establishing a
stable record of cocaine abstinence, eliminating problem
drinking, increasing his involvement in social and
recreational practices, improving his job situation,
increasing his skill in managing anger, and improving
his relationship with his daughter. The one area in
which we were unable to make progress was Bill’s use
of marijuana and associated involvement with the illicit
drug abuse community. This progress is reflected in the
pre- to posttreatment changes in ASI composite scores
shown in Table 14.5. Composite scores range from
0, representing No problems in the past 30 days to 1,
representing Severe problems. Bill’s scores at the endof-
treatment assessment generally reflected substantial
improvements.

Follow-Up

Following completion of the 24-week treatment protocol,
Bill participated in a 6-month aftercare program
and completed periodic follow-up assessments for 4
years after treatment entry (see Table 14.5). Thus, we
have a relatively good picture of his progress.

Bill largely sustained the excellent progress he made
during treatment toward resolving his cocaine-use
problems. All urine toxicology tests conducted during
follow-up were negative for cocaine use. He reported
two instances of cocaine use during the 3.5-year
follow-up period, but they were separated in time, and
neither resulted in a full-blown relapse. He reported
moderate use of alcohol throughout follow-up, with

only one instance of drinking to intoxication. He continued
to smoke marijuana regularly, as he had done
during treatment.

Regarding other areas of functioning, Bill sustained
full-time employment throughout the follow-up period.
There was an episode of criminal justice involvement
at the 12-month assessment, which, according to Bill,
was unrelated to substance abuse and was resolved
before the later assessments. His depressive symptomatology
remained well below intake levels throughout
the follow-up period. Progress in other areas of functioning
largely was sustained through follow-up, until
the 48-month assessment, when a medical crisis arose.
Bill developed a neuromuscular condition involving
periodic episodes of full paralysis. He was also experiencing
more routine but nevertheless painful dental
problems. At the time of that assessment, Bill was still
undergoing testing for the neuromuscular problem and
did not have a diagnosis. This crisis had not precipitated
a relapse back to cocaine or other drug abuse, which
underscores the substantial progress Bill had made
with those problems. The increases in ASI drug scale
scores at that 48-month assessment were related to taking
pain medication for the dental problems. Clearly,
though, the medical conditions were having a destabilizing
effect physically and psychologically. Although
Bill recognized that the situation put him at increased
risk for relapse, he did not deem the situation at that
time to warrant reentry into treatment. Treatment staff
commended Bill on his sustained progress in abstaining
from cocaine and alcohol abuse, and reassured him
that he could return to treatment if the need arose.

In this chapter we have presented the most up-to-date
scientific information available on effective clinical
management of illicit drug use disorders. In the process,
we have tried to illustrate what have come to be considered
principles of effective treatment for illicit drug
use disorders in general, using cocaine dependence as a
specific exemplar. We have emphasized one efficacious,
multielement treatment approach but have underscored
how it contains elements of all of the empirically based
behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapies except
behavioral family therapy. We realize that limitations
in resources and other practical constraints will prevent
many clinicians from utilizing the treatment practices
just as we have outlined them in this chapter. Costs for
the treatment provided to Bill were covered exclusively
through a research grant. However, we hope that this
information offers insights into the important elements
of effective treatment for illicit drug use disorders. We
also hope that this information makes the job of clinicians
who are out there in the trenches treating the
drug-dependent population a little easier and, we hope,
their practices more effective.

evidence‑Based relationships
and responsiveness for Depression
and substance Abuse

JohN c. Norcross
larry e. Beutler

implicit in all chapters in this book is the necessity of tailoring the treatment in a flexible
manner to the individual patient, as well as attending to patient, therapist, and relationship
factors. some chapters also purposefully integrate and “match” techniques from
different approaches into the treatment protocols described to accomplish specific goals,
such as motivational interviewing (see Payne, ellard, farchione, fairholme, & Barlow,
Chapter 6) or attention to the social and interpersonal context of the patient. But in this
chapter the topics are made explicit by two senior and distinguished clinical investigators
who have made it their life work to pursue these themes in a rigorous and empirical manner.
The unique contribution of this chapter is that transdiagnostic patient and therapist
factors, as well as matching the style of the treatment protocol (e.g., less directive or more
directive depending on the level of resistance or “readiness” of the patient for therapy),
are also evidence‑based procedures and deserve description in this book. Thus, it is important
not only to choose the most effective change procedure for a given disorder,
such as panic disorder, but also to attend explicitly to relationship factors; to provide for
consistent, bidirectional feedback between patient and the therapist; and to establish
a transparent, collaborative therapeutic style. The authors demonstrate this integrative
approach in the context of the fascinating case of “Amber,” a young woman suffering
from polysubstance abuse and depression. Awareness of this perspective will enrich the
reader’s appreciation of all of the chapters in this book.—D. H. B.

Psychotherapy is a treatment method and a healing
relationship fit to the individual patient and context.
On this, virtually every practitioner (and patient) will
agree. However, selection of the particular treatment
method has received the lion’s share of attention in the
movement toward evidence-based practice (Norcross,
Beutler, & Levant, 2006). Matching the treatment
method to the patient is helpful indeed, but it is also
clinically incomplete given that the therapy relation


ship frequently accounts for much of the success (and
failure) of psychotherapy (Norcross, 2011). Moreover,
psychological science directs us to which relationship
behaviors and matches contribute to treatment outcomes
across the spectrum of psychological disorders
(Beutler, 2009).

As virtually every psychotherapist also knows, psychotherapy
should be tailored to the individuality of
the patient and the singularity of his/her context. As

617


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

early as 1919, Freud introduced psychoanalytic psychotherapy
as an alternative to classical analysis, based on
the recognition that the more rarified approach lacked
universal applicability (Wolitzky, 2011). The mandate
for individualizing psychotherapy was embodied in
Gordon Paul’s (1967, p. 111, original emphasis) iconic
question: “What treatment, by whom, is most effective
for this individual with that specific problem, and
under which set of circumstances?” Every psychotherapist
recognizes that what works for one person may not
work for another; we seek “different strokes for different
folks.”

Only in the past two decades has sufficient research
been conducted to operationalize these noble intentions
into specific matching guidelines. Particularly absent
until recently has been research matching psychotherapy
to the entire person of the patient, beyond his/her
disorder. As Sir William Osler (1906), father of modern
medicine, said: “It is sometimes much more important
to know what sort of a patient has a disease than what
sort of disease a patient has.”

The process of creating this optimal fit in psychotherapy
has been accorded multiple names: treatment
adaptation, responsiveness, attunement, matchmaking,
customizing, prescriptionism, treatment selection,
specificity factor, differential therapeutics, tailoring,
and individualizing. By whatever name, the goal is to
enhance treatment effectiveness by tailoring it to the individual
and his/her singular situation. In other words,
psychotherapists endeavor to create a new therapy for
each patient.

In this chapter, we apply our integrative psychotherapy
to comorbid depression and substance abuse. We
begin with an overview of the approach and its research
evidence, particularly the evidence-based therapy relationship
and responsiveness or fit to individual patients.
The co-occurrence of mood disorders and substance
abuse is outlined, and the step-by-step treatment selection
is demonstrated. We conclude with a detailed
case illustration of “Amber,” a woman suffering from
chronic depression, substance abuse, and a host of other
psychological disorders.

overview of our aPProach

Our approach to psychotherapy is broadly characterized
as integrative and specifically labeled “systematic
eclectic” or “systematic treatment selection.” Psychotherapy
integration is characterized by dissatisfaction

with single-school approaches and a concomitant desire
to look across school boundaries to see how patients
can benefit from other ways of conducting psychotherapy
(Norcross & Goldfried, 2005). We attempt
to customize psychological treatments and therapeutic
relationships to the specific and varied needs of individual
patients as defined by a multitude of diagnostic
and particularly nondiagnostic considerations. We do
so by drawing on effective methods across theoretical
schools (eclecticism), by matching those methods to
particular clients on the basis of evidence-based principles
(treatment selection), and by adhering to an explicit
and orderly (systematic) model.

The clinical reality is that no single psychotherapy is
effective for all patients and situations, no matter how
good it is for some. Evidence-based practice has come
to demand a flexible, if not integrative, perspective.
Psychotherapy universally applied as one size fits all is
proving impossible and, in some cases, even unethical.
Of course, that would simplify treatment selection—
give every patient the same brand of psychotherapy!—
but it flies in the face of what we know about individual
differences, patient preferences, and disparate cultures.

Imposing a parallel situation onto other health care
professions drives the point home. To take a medical
metaphor, would you entrust your health to a physician
who prescribed the identical treatment (say, antibiotics
or neurosurgery) for every patient and illness encountered?
Or, to take an educational analogy, would you
prize instructors who employed the same pedagogical
method (say, a lecture) for every educational opportunity?
Or would you entrust your child to a child
care worker who delivers the identical response (say, a
nondirective attitude or a slap on the bottom) to every
child and every misbehavior? “No” is probably your resounding
answer. Psychotherapy clients deserve no less
consideration.

Concisely put, we believe that no theory is uniformly
valid, and no mechanism of therapeutic action is equally
applicable to all individuals. As a consequence, we
select different methods and relationships according to
the patient and the context. The result is a more efficient
and efficacious therapy—and one that fits both the client
and the clinician.

On the face of it, of course, virtually every clinician
endorses matching the therapy to the individual client.
After all, who can seriously dispute the notion that psychological
treatment should be tailored to the needs of
the individual patient? Indeed, treatment manuals increasingly
focus on ways to be flexible—but they all


Depression and Substance Abuse

still work within a confined set of theoretical parameters
and technical procedures. In contrast, our integrative
therapy goes beyond this simple acknowledgment
of the need for flexibility in several ways:

••
Our integrative therapy is derived directly from
outcome research rather than from an idiosyncratic
theory or seat-of-the-pants syncretism.

••
Our therapy embraces the potential contributions
of multiple systems of psychotherapy rather than
working from within a single theoretical system.

••
Our treatment selection is predicated on many diagnostic
and nondiagnostic client characteristics,
in contrast to relying on patient diagnosis alone.

••
Our aim is to offer optimal treatment methods and
healing relationships, whereas many therapists
focus narrowly on selecting methods. Both interventions
and relationships, both the instrumental
and the interpersonal—intertwined as they are—
are required in effective psychotherapy.

••
Matching methods and relationships to the client
occurs throughout the course of therapy, not only
at pretreatment as a case formulation.

••
As will be evident in the case illustration that follows,
clients evolve and progress—and their initial
complaints are not necessarily their primary
disorders or goals at the conclusion of treatment.
Our integrative therapy tracks their progress and
evolves with them through termination.

research eviDeNce

The outcome research supporting our approach comes
in several guises. First and most generally, the entire
body of psychotherapy research has provided the foundation
for the key principles on which integrative treatment
rests. This is the basis from which we have systematized
the process of treatment selection. A genuine
advantage of being integrative is the vast amount of
research attesting to the efficacy of psychotherapy and
pointing to the differential effectiveness among different
types of patients. Integration tries to incorporate
state-of-the-art research findings into its open framework,
in contrast to becoming yet another “system” of
psychotherapy.

We embrace the robust common factors among the
therapies and, at the same time, capitalize on their differences.
Integration gathers, in the words of Abraham
Lincoln, “strange, discordant, and even, hostile elements

from the four winds.” Diverse treatment methods are
optimally employed with patients and in situations for
which research has found evidence of effectiveness. We
hasten to add that the incorporation of these treatments
should occur within a systematic process and an integrative
perspective, that is, be integrative, not syncretic.

A second and more specific source of research evidence
is our ongoing programmatic research on treatment
selection according to client characteristics (for
details, see Castonguay & Beutler, 2006; Norcrosss,
2011). Below we summarize the research evidence underpinning
evidence-based therapy relationships and
responsive fit to transdiagnostic patient characteristics.

Relationships That Work

Decades of psychological science have identified many
of the relational behaviors that contribute to and predict
successful psychotherapy, and multiple meta-analyses
have refined our understanding of which of these
work to improve outcomes (Norcross, 2011). In fact,
evidence-based therapy relationships have been highlighted
on the National Registry of Evidence-Based
Programs and Practices (NREPP; www.nrepp.samhsa.
gov/norcross.aspx). Below we summarize the research
evidence for those elements of the therapy relationship
that are primarily provided by the psychotherapist.

The Alliance

The alliance is an emergent quality of partnership between
therapist and client, built principally on a positive
emotional bond between therapist and client, and their
ability to agree on the goals of treatment and to reach a
mutual consensus on the tasks. A meta-analysis of 201
studies, involving over 14,000 adult patients, found an
effect size (d) of 0.60 (Horvath, Del Re, Flückiger, &
Symonds, 2011), which describes the degree to which
the alliance is related to and predicts psychotherapy
outcome. (In all instances of reporting effect sizes in
this chapter, we use d, where 0 indicates no effect; 0.20
represents a small effect; 0.50 represents a medium effect;
and 0.80 and above, a large effect [Cohen, 1988].)

As in the adult research, the alliance in youth treatment
is characterized as a collaborative bond between
client and therapist, but the psychotherapist typically
established two alliances: one with the youth and one
with the parent or guardian. A meta-analysis of 29 studies
with 2,202 youth clients and 892 parents estimated
the association between alliance and outcome in youth


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

therapy (Shirk & Karver, 2011). The effect size (d) was
0.39, between both the therapist and the youth, and the
therapist and the parent/guardian.

Just as in individual therapy, the alliance in couple
and family therapy (CFT) involves the creation of a
strong emotional bond, as well as negotiation of goals
and tasks with the therapist. However, family members
often vary in the degree to which they like and agree
with the therapist about treatment goals and tasks, thus
creating multiple alliances that interact systemically.
A meta-analysis of 24 studies (7 couples, 17 family
studies; 1,461 clients) was conducted in which CFT
alliances were used to predict treatment improvement
midtreatment and final outcomes (Friedlander, Escudero,
Heatherington, & Diamond, 2011). The effect size

(d) was 0.53, indicating that the alliance accounted for
a substantial proportion of variance in CFT retention
and outcome. According to conventional benchmarks,
this represents a medium effect size in the behavioral
sciences; the success rate increases from 37 to 63% in
low versus high alliance cases.
Cohesion in Group Therapy

Probably the closest parallel of the alliance in individual
therapy is cohesion in group therapy. A metaanalysis
of 40 studies, comprising 3,323 patients, was
conducted on the association between cohesion and the
success of group psychotherapy (Burlingame, McClendon,
& Alonso, 2011). The effect size was a moderate d
of 0.52. This indicates that, as cohesion levels increase
in groups, client outcomes improve and psychological
symptoms decrease. This correlation was found for
therapy groups across different settings (inpatient and
outpatient) and diagnostic classifications.

Empathy

Much of the research continues to follow Carl Rogers’s
(1957) definition of empathy as the therapist’s sensitive
ability to understand the client’s thoughts, feelings, and
struggles from the client’s point of view and communicate
that understanding to the client. A meta-analysis
examined the association between therapist empathy
and treatment outcome (Elliott, Bohart, Watson, &
Greenberg, 2011). The analysis of 57 studies resulted in
an overall d of 0.61, a medium effect, between therapist
empathy and client success (suggesting a success rate
of 57% compared to 43% for higher vs. lower empathy).
Empathy predicted treatment outcome consistently

across different theoretical orientations (e.g., cognitivebehavioral,
psychodynamic, humanistic).

Collecting Client Feedback

In this relational behavior, the therapist systematically
monitors a client’s mental health vital signs through
the use of standardized scales and expected treatment
response. Results of this monitoring are then fed back
in real-time to the therapist and discussed in session
with the client. A meta-analysis of nine studies on the
impact of feedback methods on treatment outcomes
showed effect sizes (d) between 0.49 and 0.70 (Lambert
& Shimokawa, 2011). Rates of patient deterioration in
psychotherapy were cut by two-thirds when client feedback
was used with warning signals for at-risk patients.
Accordingly, patients are better off when practitioners
routinely monitor their ongoing mental health functioning.
Such monitoring leads to increased opportunities
to repair alliance ruptures, enhance motivation, and
reduce premature termination. Systematic feedback is
especially useful in helping clinicians identify the possible
failure of ongoing treatment and collaborate with
the client in restoring positive outcomes.

Goal Consensus

Agreement about the nature of the problem for which
the client is seeking help, goals for treatment, and the
way that the two parties work together to achieve these
goals are the essence of goal consensus. A meta-analysis
addressed how patient–therapist goal consensus relates
to psychotherapy outcome (Tryon & Winograd, 2011).
The goal consensus–outcome meta-analysis—based
on 15 studies with a total sample of 1,302 patients—
yielded an effect size (d) of 0.72. This substantial result
reflects the meaningful positive outcomes that are associated
with higher agreement between therapists and
clients about the aims of treatment and how to accomplish
such aims.

Collaboration

To help clients fulfill mutual treatment goals, professionals
and patients should function as a team. The
collaboration–outcome meta-analysis—based on 19
studies involving 2,260 patients—yielded an d of 0.70
(Tryon & Winograd, 2011). As with goal consensus,
this result suggests that patient well-being is considerably
enhanced with a better collaborative relationship.


Depression and Substance Abuse

Affirmation/Positive Regard

To investigate the association between therapists’ positive
regard and treatment outcome, Farber and Doolin
(2011) performed a meta-analysis of 18 studies. The
overall effect size among these studies was 0.57, indicating
that positive regard has a moderate association
with therapeutic outcomes. Thus, like many other relational
factors, positive regard appears to be a significant
but hardly an exhaustive part of the process–outcome
equation.

Researchers cannot study all of these relationship
behaviors simultaneously, and there is considerable
overlap in these constructs and in the amount of variance
they account for in psychotherapy. At the same
time, it is demonstrably true that these relationship
behaviors are important predictors and contributors to
psychotherapy success that can be learned and, in most
cases, taught.

Patient–Treatment Fits That Work

The question of fit or responsiveness becomes which
patient transdiagnostic dimensions can reliably guide
us in adapting psychotherapy to different clients or with
the same client at different points in time. More than
200 client variables have been proposed as potential
matchmaking markers, and at least 100 of these have
been subjected to some research scrutiny (Clarkin &
Levy, 2004). We commissioned a series of original
meta-analyses on the research linking treatment outcome
to patient characteristics, and the results of those
analyses point to at least five potent matches: reactance
level, stages of change, coping style, preferences, and
culture (Norcross, 2011). Following are thumbnail descriptions
of each, and we demonstrate their respective
uses later in our case study.

Reactance Level

Research confirms what one would expect: High patient
reactance or resistance is consistently associated
with poorer therapy outcomes (in 82% of studies). But
matching therapist directiveness to client reactance
mightily improves therapy outcome. Specifically, clients
presenting with high reactance benefited more
from self-control methods, minimal therapist directiveness,
and paradoxical interventions. By contrast, clients
with low reactance benefited more from therapist directiveness
and explicit guidance. This strong, consis


tent finding can be expressed as a large effect size (d)
averaging 0.76 (Beutler, Harwood, Michelson, Song, &
Holman, 2011).

Stages of Change

The amount of progress clients make in psychotherapy
tends to be a direct function of their pretreatment stage
of change—precontemplation, contemplation, preparation,
action, and maintenance. A meta-analysis of 39
psychotherapy studies (Norcross, Krebs, & Prochaska,
2011) found a mean effect size (d) of 0.46, indicating
that the stages reliably predict outcomes in psychotherapy.
This effect has been found to be true for patients
suffering from dozens of mental and medical disorders
immediately following intervention, as well as 12
months afterward.

More importantly, research in behavioral medicine
and psychotherapy converge in showing that different
processes of change are differentially effective in certain
stages of change. A meta-analysis (Rosen, 2000)
of 47 studies examining relationships among the stages
and the processes of change showed large effect sizes
(d = 0.70 and 0.80). That is, adapting psychotherapy to
the client’s stage of change significantly improves outcome
across disorders (Prochaska & Norcross, 2013).

These client markers provide prescriptive as well
as proscriptive guidance to the psychotherapist. In reactance,
the prescriptive implication is to match the
therapist’s amount of directiveness to the patient’s reactance,
and the proscriptive implication is to avoid
meeting high client reactance with high therapist direction.
In stages of change, action-oriented therapies
are quite effective with individuals who are in
the preparation or action stages. However, these same
therapies tend to be less effective or even detrimental
with individuals in the precontemplation and contemplation
stages.

Coping Style

The research has been devoted primarily to the externalizing
(impulsive, stimulation-seeking, extroverted)
and internalizing (self-critical, inhibited, introverted)
coping styles. Approximately 80% of the studies investigating
this dimension have demonstrated differential
effects of the type of treatment as a function of patient
coping style. A meta-analysis of 12 of those studies, involving
more than 1,000 patients, revealed a medium
effect (d = 0.55) for matching therapist method to pa



CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

tient coping style (Beutler, Harwood, Michelson, et al.,
2011). Specifically, interpersonal and insight-oriented
therapies are more effective among internalizing patients,
whereas symptom-focused and skill-building
therapies are more effective among externalizing
patients. This pattern is frequently known for child
patients—say, a depressed internalizing girl versus a
hyperactive externalizing boy—but less well known
for the adult patients on whom the meta-analysis was
conducted.

Preferences

Client preferences and goals are frequently direct indicators
of the best therapeutic method and healing relationship
for that person. Decades of empirical evidence
attest to the benefit of seriously considering, and at least
beginning with, the relational preferences and treatment
goals of the client. A meta-analysis of 35 studies
compared the treatment outcomes of clients matched
to their preferred treatment to outcomes of clients not
matched to their preference. The findings indicated a
medium positive effect (d = 0.31) in favor of clients
matched to preferences. Clients who were matched to
their preference were one-third less likely to drop out of
psychotherapy—a powerful effect indeed (Swift, Callahan,
& Vollmer, 2011).

Culture

A meta-analysis of 65 studies, encompassing 8,620 clients,
evaluated the effectiveness of culturally adapted
therapies versus traditional, nonadapted therapies. The
most frequent methods of adaptation in the studies involved
incorporating cultural content and values, using
the client’s preferred language, and matching therapists
of similar ethnicity. The results revealed a positive
effect (d = 0.46) in favor of clients receiving culturally
adapted treatments (Smith, Rodriguez, & Bernal,
2011). Cultural “fit” works, not only as an ethical commitment
but also as an evidence-based practice.

DePressioN aND suBstaNce aBuse

Depression is the most prevalent comorbid condition
among the behavioral health disorders, co-occurring at
very high rates in almost all behavioral and many medical
disorders. It is especially likely to co-occur among
those with substance abuse; posttraumatic stress disor


der (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders; and heart disease,
cancer, and many other physical diseases (Beutler,
Clarkin, & Bongar, 2000; Kessler et al., 2005). As
many as 80% of patients with chronic medical conditions
suffer from comorbid (unipolar) depression. The
prevalence rates of comorbid depression and substance
abuse are so consistent that many have suggested that
substance abuse may be a manifestation of depressive
spectrum disorders). This may also be true for other
disorders, such as PTSD, in which both depression and
chemical abuse frequently seems to substitute for the
PTSD symptoms following mass trauma (Housley &
Beutler, 2007).

The lifetime prevalence rates for comorbid depression
and substance abuse are high, reaching a figure of
nearly 10%, closely approximating the lifetime prevalence
rates of substance use disorders alone. What is
more, co-occurring depression and substance abuse
tend to follow similar patterns of response to treatment.
Virtually all structured treatments produce similar effects
among either depressed or substance-abusing patients
(Beutler & Malik, 2002). Likewise, the course
of recovery and relapse from depression is extremely
variable and generally more similar to that of the extant
comorbid conditions than to other instances of depression.
Reviews of the literature conclude that there is
little evidence of either a specific course of depression
or a specific treatment that is uniquely effective (e.g.,
Cuijpers, van Straten, Andersson, & van Oppen, 2008;
Cuijpers et al., 2010); rather, depression functions more
as an indexing symptom of distress and impairment
than as a separate disorder in its own right.

As we discuss throughout this chapter, it is also now
relatively clear that the therapy relationship and matching
strategies that positively impact the treatment of
depression work in the same manner to ameliorate substance
abuse. Beutler and colleagues (2003), for example,
studied a group of patients with comorbid depression
and substance dependence, comparing the relative
and absolute influence of patient predisposing factors
(e.g., reactance level, coping styles), treatment characteristics,
the therapy relationship (as measured by the
alliance), and the fit between the treatment characteristics
and the patient factors. Cross-cutting categories of
psychotherapy included therapist level of directiveness
and the relative proportion of insight and symptomfocused
interventions (Beutler et al., 2000).

Figures 15.1 and 15.2 show that all of these factors—
patient factors, treatment methods, therapy relationship,
and the degree of fit between the treatment and

aPPlicatioN of our aPProach

Treatment selection invariably involves iterative, recursive
decisions about setting, format, intensity, pharmacotherapy,
therapy relationship, and treatment methods.
Why? Because each client responds best to a different
configuration or mix of components. We cannot and
should not assume that the treatment will automatically
be outpatient individual psychotherapy on a weekly
basis. Below we consider each of these decisions, devoting
more time to selection of treatment methods
predicated on the patient’s diagnostic and transdiagnostic
features.

Treatment Settings

The setting is where the treatment occurs—a psychotherapist’s
office, a psychiatric unit, a halfway house,
an outpatient clinic, a secondary school, or a medical
ward. The choice of setting depends primarily on
the relative need for restricting and/or supporting the
patient given the severity of psychopathology and the
amount of support in the patient’s environment. As
applied to depression and substance abuse, the urgent
question is whether hospitalization or detoxification is
required for either.

Each treatment decision is related to the other treatment
decisions, as well as to certain patient characteristics.
The optimal setting, for example, is partially
determined by the level of functional impairment and
partially reflects reactance level. Those clients who are
most impaired and resistant have the greatest need for a
restrictive environment. Outpatient treatment is always
preferred over a restrictive setting; indeed, preference
is nearly always for the least restrictive setting.

Therapy Formats

The format indicates who directly participates in the
treatment, the interpersonal context within which the
therapy is conducted. The typical treatment formats—
individual, group, couples, and family—are characterized
by a set of treatment parameters, all determined
largely by the number and identities of participants.

Decades of research support the effectiveness and
especially the cost-efficiency of group, couple, and
family therapy. Therapy conducted in these formats is
generally as effective as individual therapy, but patients
and therapists usually prefer the individual format.
Even so, a multiperson format is indicated when social

support systems are low and if one or more of the major
problems involves a specific other person.

Treatment Intensity

The intensity of psychotherapy is the product of the duration
of the treatment episode, the length of a session,
and the frequency of contact. It may also entail the use
of multiple formats, such as both group and individual
therapy or both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.

Intensity should be gauged as a function of problem
complexity and level of impairment in the context of the
patient’s resources. For example, a patient with a multiplicity
of treatment goals, severe functional impairment,
few social supports, and a personality disorder is likely to
require substantially longer, more intense, and more varied
treatment than a patient with a simpler problem. Patients
suffering from both mood disorders and substance
abuse almost always require intense and long-term care.

Pharmacotherapy

Psychotropic medications are particularly indicated for
more severe and chronic disorders, which is the case
with the majority of depressed substance abusers. Unlike
some systems of psychotherapy, integrative psychotherapies
are well suited to the integration of pharmacotherapy
and psychotherapy. This position, of course,
is consistent with the pluralism underlying treatment
selection. But like most health care professionals, integrative
therapists are especially keen to avoid treating
substance abuse with only another substance.

Thus, we offer a cautionary note here: Medication
alone is not an integrative treatment. Tightening insurance
reimbursements and restricting psychological
services unduly favor pharmacotherapy at the expense
of psychotherapy for virtually every disorder. This situation
is clinically and empirically appalling to us because
decades of research indicate that, in fact, there
is frequently no stronger medicine than psychotherapy
for both clinical depression and substance abuse (e.g.,
Antonuccio, 1995; Antonuccio, Danton, & DeNelsky,
1995; DeRubeis et al., 2005; Hollon, 1990). The
preponderance of scientific evidence shows that psychotherapy
is generally as effective as medications
in treating nonpsychotic disorders, especially when
patient-rated measures, side effect profiles, and longterm
follow-up are considered. This is not to devalue
the salutary impact of pharmacotherapy; rather, it is to
underscore the reliable potency of psychotherapy.


Depression and Substance Abuse

Therapy Relationship

All psychotherapy occurs within the sensitive and
curative context of the human connection. Although
we emphasized this point and its research underpinnings
earlier in this chapter, we hasten to dispute the
unfortunate misperception of treatment selection as a
disembodied, technique-oriented process. Our integrative
approach attempts to fit not only therapy methods
but also relationship stances to individual clients. One
way to conceptualize the matter, paralleling the notion
of “treatments of choice” in terms of techniques, is
how clinicians determine “therapeutic relationships of
choice” in terms of interpersonal stances (Norcross &
Beutler, 1997). Conducting the best of evidence-based
treatment all comes to naught unless the client feels
safe, cared for, and connected.

Early on, then, we strive to develop a working alliance
and to demonstrate empathy for the client’s experiences
and concerns. We proceed collaboratively in
establishing treatment goals, in securing the patient’s
preferences, in allaying the initially expected distrust
and fear, and in presenting ourselves as caring and supportive.
Of course, the therapy relationship must also
be matched or tailored to the individual patient and his/
her cultures.

This imperative to fit or match psychotherapy to the
patient can be misconstrued as an authority figure/
therapist prescribing a particular form of psychotherapy
for a passive client. The clinical reality is precisely
the opposite. Our goal is for an empathic therapist to
work toward an optimal relationship that enhances collaboration,
is consistent with the client’s preferences,
and secures the patient’s sense of safety and commitment.
The nature of such an optimal relationship is
determined by patient preferences, cultures, and personality.
If a client frequently resists, for example, then
the therapist considers whether he/she is pushing something
that the client finds incompatible (preferences), or
whether the client is not ready to make those changes
(stage of change) or is uncomfortable with a directive
style (reactance). We lead by following and respecting
the client (Norcross, 2010).

%%%CUT%%%
Treatment Methods

When clinicians first meet clients, they are tempted to
focus immediately and intensely on particular therapy
methods and strategies. However, as we have noted,
treatment selection always involves a cascading series

of interrelated decisions. A truly integrated treatment
requires that the therapist recursively consider these
other decisions before jumping to therapy methods.

The selection of methods and strategies is the most
controversial component of integrative therapy for
depression and substance abuse. While there may be
occasional professional disagreement about the ideal
treatment setting and format, proponents of disparate
theoretical orientations frequently endorse decidedly
different positions on which methods should be used.
Moreover, any given method can be used in different
ways. Thus, rather than focusing on specific techniques
per se, we prefer prescribing change principles. Principles
are flexible, yet specific. Each principle can be
implemented in a number of ways and with diverse
techniques, depending on the predilections and skills
of the therapist. By mixing and matching methods from
different therapy systems, we tailor the treatment to the
particular patient (Norcross, 2013).

Humans, including psychotherapists, cannot process
more than a handful of matching dimensions at
once (Halford, Baker, McCredden, & Bain, 2005). As
discussed earlier, we principally consider five transdiagnostic
patient characteristics (reactance level, stage
of change, coping style, preferences, and culture) that
have a proven empirical track record as prescriptive
guidelines.

What about diagnosis in treatment selection? When
it comes to the psychological treatment of unipolar depression
and substance abuse, the diagnosis does not
suggest a particular treatment, other than to favor those
with the most research support. That is, diagnosis has
the least evidence of differential treatment effects. In
any case, we reiterate that reliance on diagnosis alone
to select a treatment plan is empirically questionable
and clinically suspect. Instead, as applied to depression
and substance abuse, we select treatment methods on
the basis of matching the outcome research to those
transdiagnostic patient features of reactance, stage of
change, preferences, coping style, and culture.

Clinical Assessment

Our approach strongly values clinical assessment
that guides effective treatment (Harwood, Beutler, &
Groth-Marnat, 2011). Such assessment is conducted
early in psychotherapy to select treatment methods and
therapy relationships that are most likely to be effective,
throughout therapy to monitor the patient’s response
and to make midcourse adjustments as needed,


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

and toward the end of psychotherapy to evaluate the
outcome of the entire enterprise. Thus, assessment is
continuous, collaborative, and invaluable.

Clinical assessment of the patient in integrative therapy
is relatively traditional, with one major exception.
The assessment interview(s) entail collecting information
on presenting problems, relevant histories, and
treatment expectations and goals, as well as building
a working alliance. As psychologists, we also typically
use formal psychological testing as a means of securing
additional data and identifying disorders. We recommend
both symptomatic rating forms (e.g., Beck Depression
Inventory–II [BDI-II], Symptom Checklist
90—Revised) and broader measures of pathology and
personality (e.g., Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory–II, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory–
III).

The one way in which our assessment departs from
the usual is that we collect, from the outset, information
on multiple patient characteristics that will guide
treatment selection.

The five patient characteristics identified in the research
(as noted earlier) guide us in identifying a beneficial
fit between patient and treatment. Of course, we
are not confined to these five considerations, but they
do illustrate our process of clinical assessment and
treatment matching.

A free, online program has been developed (www.
innerlife.com) to guide patients in selecting an optimal
treatment and finding a clinician who can best implement
that treatment. A companion program is available
to clinicians (at the same website) for a modest cost to
help them plan a research-informed treatment that is
both broad and flexible in applying fundamental principles
of change. Completing the assessment requires
approximately 15 minutes and takes the person through
a series of item-branching questions. At completion,
the Innerlife STS renders a report to the patient that addresses
treatment issues tailored to the person:

••
Potential Areas of Concern

••
Treatments to Consider

••
Treatments to Avoid

••
Compatible Therapist Styles

••
Picking a Psychotherapist

••
Self-Help Resources

A similar set of treatment issues are addressed in
more detail in the parallel report directed to the clinician,
and available through the same website. This

more detailed report also includes programmatic considerations
that should be addressed in structuring the
environment and directing the staff of treatment centers
in what is needed for effective change.

Initial Encounters

Amber’s father initially contacted our private practice
office seeking psychotherapy for his 32-year-old,
divorced European American daughter following her
scheduled release from prison the next month. The father
was informed of the 3-month waiting list, referred
to an office mate psychiatrist to begin pharmacotherapy,
and offered names of other psychologists. Amber
and her parents decided to wait to see one of the authors

(J. C. N.) but she began attending Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA) meetings 5 days a week and started an antidepressant
(fluoxetine, to 80 mg) and an anxiolytic
(BuSpar, 20 mg three times a day) for 2 months before
commencing individual psychotherapy. Although the
delay was not clinically advisable, it did fortuitously
provide a baseline and control comparison for the subsequent
effects of psychotherapy. That is, at our initial
evaluation, we were able to establish the extant effects
of the medications and AA participation apart from
and predating the psychotherapy. The two medications
were continued over the course of psychotherapy and
were monitored by a psychiatrist throughout.
At our first session, I began with standard open-ended
questions:

tHeraPist: Ms. Smith, what brings you here today?
What do you hope to accomplish?

client: Well, I am depressed and a recovering addict.
I was released a couple of months ago from prison,
where I was diagnosed with borderline personality
disorder. I suppose I want to work on all of that.

We begin with Ms. Smith’s story and with respect. I
address the client as Ms. Smith until or if she grants me
permission to call her Amber, which she does within 10
minutes. We also begin with the client’s narrative story
and concerns. The primary task in the first session is
twofold: to cultivate an accepting, empathic relationship,
one in which she will feel understood and prized,
and to collect sufficient information to begin planning
treatment together.


Depression and Substance Abuse

A tumultuous and complicated history pours out of
Amber: For as long as she can remember, she has felt
depressed, lonely, and incompetent despite having a
loving and stable family. Three courses of psychotherapy,
ranging from 3 months to a year each, and multiple
antidepressants did little to relieve her misery. Approximately
5 years ago, she began embezzling funds
from the legal firm where she worked as a paralegal and
assisted with the bookkeeping. The stolen money was
used to finance an escalating and expensive addiction
to opiates, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. “They help
me get numb.” Her pathological gambling and shoplifting
escalated as the drugs loosened her impulse control
and impaired her judgment further. She descended into
burglary to support her habit and into infidelity with
men who supplied her with drugs. Her self-cutting,
emotional lability, and fear of abandonment intensified.
Amber’s embezzlement was discovered by her law
firm, the police caught her with stolen items, and her
husband of 3 years learned of the serial affairs. Amber
was fired, incarcerated, and divorced in a matter of
weeks. She then spent 2 years in county and state prisons
until she was released early for good behavior and
sentenced to several years of parole.

An abbreviated mental status examination reveals
that this well-oriented, well-nourished woman appears
younger than her stated age. Amber is polite,
deferential, and verbal throughout the interview. She
is visibly distressed by her condition and acknowledges
suicidal ideation, but no intentions or plans.
Her mood is depressed and anxious but appropriate.
There is no evidence or complaints of psychosis,
mania, or aggression. Detailed assessment of her
functioning will be undertaken between sessions and
in subsequent visits.

Upon learning that Amber’s three previous experiences
with psychotherapy did not prove particularly
successful, I began to explore what did and did not
work in those treatments, thereby defining and aligning
our collaborative relationship.

tHeraPist: From those experiences, Amber, you certainly
learned how a psychotherapist could be most
useful to you. What would he or she ideally do? And
what should he or she not do?

amBer: Well, I don’t really know . . . (sounding hesitant
and incredulous)

tHeraPist: I did not mean to put you on the spot [attributing
her reluctance to voice preferences to my

unexpected question rather than her core deference
to authorities]. In our work together, I will be asking
you to provide feedback on our progress and on
what we do here. That’s the honest partnership we
hope to create. Perhaps you have had some thoughts
about what worked and what did not in your previous
treatment?

amBer: Well, the one with Dr. X did not teach me anything,
but he was very nice and supportive. I liked
him but I did not make any progress. Dr. Y asked
me to keep free associating and tell him my dreams.
That was interesting, but did not leave me feeling
any better.

tHeraPist: Do I have it right that we should not repeat
those mistakes: only nice without teaching you new
skills and leaving you too . . . unstructured?

amBer: . . . and too passive. I need some skills, directions,
ways to deal with all of this [her problems].

Amber nominates additional preferences for transparency
in the process, between-session goals (also
known as homework), and reading materials. Amber’s
preferences naturally segue into an exploration of our
respective roles and her active collaboration in psychotherapy.
She intellectually understands the importance
of an active client but, emotionally, feels inadequate to
undertake the task: “I’ve felt like this my entire life. I
know what I want, but can’t get there.”

Thus, psychotherapy begins with both an explanation
and an experience of the way we might proceed. To
ensure that treatment proceeds with her informed consent
and active collaboration, we jointly develop three
between-session activities. First, Amber grants me
permission to speak with the psychiatrist and to secure
her psychological records from prison, and asks me
to respond to her probation officer, should he contact
me. Second, at my request, Amber agrees to complete
a life history inventory and a series of comprehensive
computer-administered psychological tests to cover the
essential ground. We will review her test responses next
session. And third, Amber will prioritize her treatment
goals. Among the desirable changes, which would she
like to focus on at the outset?

All of these activities are designed to jump-start the
therapy process and to activate Amber’s collaboration,
despite her unsuccessful therapy experiences in the
past. We both leave the first session feeling connected,
more optimistic, but a bit overwhelmed by the magnitude
of her conditions.

History and Background

Amber was the youngest of three children (girl, boy,
girl), and experienced normal developmental milestones.
According to her recollections and her mother’s
independent report, Amber had suffered pervasive
anxiety “since birth” and throughout adolescence. Neither
the patient nor her parents reported any history of
trauma; instead, all agreed that family life was stable
and relatively benign. Both parents were professionals,
and both appeared to care deeply about Amber and her
future.

The patient succeeded in academics but flailed at
friendships. She completed high school with fine grades
and went on to earn a college degree and another year
of paralegal training. Starting early in school, Amber
suffered from feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem,
avoidance, and school reluctance. It was the latter and a
brief bout of being bullied that led her to the guidance
counselor in elementary school for several sessions of
counseling.

Her adolescence was punctuated by quiet academic
achievement but a series of internalizing disorders: “secret”
shoplifting, nonsuicidal self-mutilation, and alcohol
use before high school classes (“to lift my mood
and soothe my nerves”). In college, she became bulimic
for a year. She related that “no one ever knew” about
the eating disorder or the other dysfunctions, and that
she was “keeping it all inside of me.”

At that point Amber entered into individual therapy
on three occasions over a span of about 5 years, while
simultaneously working with two different psychiatrists.
When those treatments did not materially reduce
her distress, Amber reported that she “gave up” and
began the downward spiral of addiction, impulse dyscontrol,
and embezzlement that led to her being fired,
incarcerated, and divorced in a matter of weeks.

Medical history was unremarkable: a bout of childhood
asthma that she outgrew, a broken limb secondary
to a sport accident, and seasonal allergies. With the
exception of the psychotropic medications, Amber was
not taking medications and was followed regularly by
her primary care physician and gynecologist. She enjoyed
robust physical health and was an avid exerciser.
She had begun to smoke a few cigarettes daily since
release from prison but had been abstinent from alcohol
and drugs for 60 days when we first met.

By contrast, the family history was positive for multiple
mental disorders. Her older sister was hospitalized
for an eating disorder and suffers from anxiety disor


ders, for which she continues in psychotherapy. Her
brother experiences clinical levels of anxiety and depression,
which periodically leads him to psychotherapy
and pharmacotherapy. Amber’s mother, by multiple
accounts, suffers from strong obsessive and agoraphobic
tendencies, for which she has also sought professional
care. Her father was characterized as “very anxious”
but apparently did not receive treatment.

Assessment and Formulation

In addition to a mental status examination conducted
during our second meeting and the life history inventory
completed between meetings, Amber completed
the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–2
(MMPI-2), the BDI-II, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory
(BAI). Scores on both the Beck instruments were in
the severe range at intake (BDI-II = 37; BAI = 49), as
shown in Figure 15.3. Amber’s ratings of urge intensity
in the last week on a 11-point visual analogue scale (0
= None to 10 = The worst) were 3 for alcohol, drugs 2,
gambling 8, and shoplifting 9.

Amber’s MMPI-2 profile was clinically elevated on
multiple scales, including the D, Pt, and Sc scales, and
suggested unusually severe psychological problems
(Welsh code 87**21*3460”‘9+/5:F***+L-K/). Depression,
anxiety, and social introversion were all spiking
above the 99th percentile. So, too, were two scales
measuring PTSD symptoms. The computer-generated
interpretive report indicated that “a pattern of chronic
psychological maladjustment characterizes individuals
with this MMPI-2 clinical profile. The client is overwhelmed
by anxiety, tension, and depression. She feels
helpless and alone, inadequate and insecure, and she
believes that life is hopeless and that nothing is working
out right. She attempts to control her worries through
intellectualization and unproductive self-analysis, but
she has difficulty concentrating and making decisions.”
Her coping style was markedly introverted (at the 99th
percentile) and avoidant (above the 95th percentile);
her interpersonal relationships tended to be ambivalent,
“never fully trusting or loving anyone. Many individuals
with this profile never establish lasting, intimate
relationships.” The two negative treatment indicators
were also quite elevated: Amber’s low motivation and
inability to disclose were both above the 95th percentile.


At the same time, several of Amber’s strengths were
evident despite the dismal symptom picture. Amber
had survived years of incarceration, she was voluntari

ly seeking psychotherapy following three disappointing
efforts, and she was pushing herself to relate to me
in an honest, forthcoming manner. She was a resilient
survivor with a keen intellect and a supportive family.
And she knew in her heart, as she put it, “this time, it
(psychotherapy) must work or I end up back in prison.”

At the same time, our treatment approach is less
concerned about formal diagnoses and more concerned
with understanding Amber in her uniqueness and complexity.
But this is not to say that diagnoses are inconsequential.
At the second session, Amber and I reviewed
her completed life history inventory and psychological
test results. Although not flattering, the test results
struck Amber as “exactly me.” She appreciated the candid
discussion of her multiple disorders, which she did
not experience or recall occurring in her previous treatments.
She was particularly struck by her high levels
of anxiety, which she typically labeled depression, and
multiple indications of PTSD stemming from her arrest
and incarceration.

Her mental status examination, clinical history, and
the psychological test results converged on a series of
diagnosable DSM-5 disorders: major depressive disorder,
polysubstance dependence, generalized anxiety
disorder (chronic), PTSD, pathological gambling, klep


tomania/shoplifting, borderline personality disorder,
and prominent avoidant personality features. Her Global
Assessment of Functioning (GAF) was 50.

But assessment falls short for treatment purposes if
it stops with disorders and even strengths. What about
Amber as a person, beyond a list of diagnoses? What
are her treatment preferences, her reactance level,
stage of change, coping style, and cultures? In terms
of personality traits, Amber is low in reactance, almost
pathologically unassertive and dependent, and her
coping style is fundamentally internalizing. Although
kleptomania and substance abuse typically indicate an
externalizing style, she has kept most of her problems
hidden from others. In terms of problem-specific stages
of change, Amber is in the preparation stage for her
anxiety, early action stage for depression, action stage
for gambling and shoplifting, and in the early maintenance
stage for her substance abuse. Two fear-charged
exceptions arise from this pattern of “wanting to tackle
problems:” Amber is in contemplation for the borderline
personality disorder and PTSD. She acknowledges
that she does not understand well the borderline diagnosis
made in prison, and what she understands is scary
and pessimistic. Nor is she willing yet to discuss treat



CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

ment methods for her prison-related PTSD. We accede
to her preferences and respect her early contemplation
stage for those conditions. In terms of culture, Amber
identifies herself as a female recovering addict of European
American persuasion and heterosexual orientation.


Preparing the Patient

Amber presents for the second session looking more
comfortable and less distressed. I share this observation,
and Amber responds, “I did feel better this past
week.” I ask for her impressions of our first session, as
a means of developing collaboration, collecting feedback,
and communicating the need for goal and task
consensus. We discuss Amber’s experiences, including
her perception of comfort with me and her feelings of
shame and guilt in revealing her “awful mess of a life.”
I offer that I was impressed with her openness and honesty,
particularly given her history of secrecy and the
fact that it was our first meeting Within a few minutes,
we agree that the therapist–patient fit is “good” and proceed
to review the test results (as summarized earlier).

Consistent with her stages of change, Amber decides
to focus in early sessions on treating her depression and
maintaining her drug abstinence. I concur with these
preferences because they coincide with the usual sequencing
of treatment goals with multidisordered patients:
Accord first priority to decreasing suicidal (and
return-to-prison) behaviors, then to therapy-interfering
behaviors, and then to decreasing behaviors that interfere
with quality of life (Linehan, 1993a). We agree to
begin with weekly individual psychotherapy with the
caveat that we will increase the frequency if her distress
and impairment do not decline soon.

Preparing the patient for psychotherapy occurs
in two guises: one for the role demands of psychotherapy
in general, and one for the specific treatment
methods in particular. A good portion of the second
session is occupied with laying the groundwork for
psychotherapy—confidentiality, cancellations, contacting
the therapist, handling crises, answering service,
payment, and so on—and then Amber’s role induction
as an active, informed patient of the process. As
an experienced therapy patient, Amber grasps this information
rapidly, asks a few clarifying questions, and
readily agrees to the frame of treatment. With a less
experienced patient, more time would (and should) be
devoted to these matters.

An additional element of preparation is introducing
the view that psychotherapy is a single part of the more
inclusive treatment plan. The research indicates that
patients who are functionally impaired respond best
to a comprehensive treatment. Specifically, more impaired
or disabled patients profit from more treatment,
lengthier treatment, psychoactive medication, multiple
therapy formats (individual, couple, group), and explicit
efforts to strengthen their social support networks
(Beutler, Harwood, Alimohamed, & Malik, 2002). Patients
suffering from both mood and substance disorders
are cases in point; to put it simply, complex problems
require complex treatments.

The second guise of preparation is explaining the
particular treatment methods, in this instance, beginning
with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for the
depression and relapse prevention for the substance
abuse, gambling, and shoplifting. These particular
treatments immediately suggest themselves for Amber
on several counts: They match her stage of change (action
and maintenance, respectively), her low reactance
level (calling for more directive and therapist guided
treatments), and her preferences for change tools and
homework assignments. And, of course, both CBT and
relapse prevention enjoy solid research evidence of
their effectiveness in treating Amber’s disorders.

Psychotherapy is more effective when both the method
and relationship are tailored to the client’s stage of
change and then evolve as the client moves along the
stages during the course of treatment. With contemplators,
the optimal role as therapist is akin to a Socratic
teacher who encourages clients to achieve their own insights
into their condition. Because Amber is into the
action stage, the stance morphs into an experienced,
supportive coach who has been through many crucial
matches and can provide a fine game plan.

Although the research clearly indicates that Amber’s
action and maintenance stages and her low reactance
favor the therapist’s use of directive methods, the therapist
must also sensitively broach the topic of transferring
more responsibility and self-direction to the client
over time. Amber, with a lifelong history of dependency
and low reactance, will respond best to a directive
stance on the part of the therapist. At the same time,
we must be careful not to reenact, in conscious and unconscious
ways, Amber’s unassertive and subservient
relationship with the powerful therapist. Thus, I broach
this matter early in the third session and contract for an
evolving relationship in terms of our respective roles.


Depression and Substance Abuse

tHeraPist: Last time, we agreed that I would be an
active and directive therapist with action plans and
homework in addressing your depression and drug
use. (Amber nods in agreement.) The research evidence
also supports that. My concern is that doing
so may reinforce in here your tendency to behave dependently
and defer to others. Does that make sense?

amBer: Ummmm. Yes, I had not thought about that,
but I see how that would probably happen. I would
depend more on you.

tHeraPist: That will be fine in the short run, while
we are reducing your depression and keeping you
abstinent. In the long run, your depending too much
on me compounds your unassertive personality style.
Might I suggest this as a way out of the paradox? In
our early sessions, I will be more directive, in the
lead, so that you can become less depressed and certain
in your sobriety. Once that happens, in the later
sessions, then we will ask and teach you to become
more assertive, more in the lead. It will sort of be
like AA—right now you depend a lot on your sponsor,
but one day you will be probably sponsoring others.
How does that sound?

This distinction between mediating goals and ultimate
goals is almost always enthusiastically received,
as it was by Amber. The mediating goal is to reduce
symptomatic distress; the ultimate goal is to restructure
interpersonal behavior. Psychotherapy can be more directive
in the short term to work toward more mature
and assertive relationships in the long term.

Ongoing assessment will, of course, refine Amber’s
goals, and her early success will lead to further goals.
Her immediate goals and, as she puts it, “where she
is at” (in the stages of change) are to reduce depression
and maintain her abstinence. Those goals reflect
where her commitment and action lie, representing the
best chances of reducing her suicidal ideation and her
probability of returning to prison Her chronic anxiety,
PTSD, and matrix of borderline personality symptoms
are addressed more fully in later sessions.

Monitoring Progress

We routinely collect real-time client feedback over the
course of psychotherapy regarding three crucial areas:
patient functioning/symptoms; task and goal consensus;
and satisfaction with the therapy relationship. In

terms of symptom monitoring, Amber and I agree that
she will complete the BDI-II and the BAI every four
sessions (once a month) to monitor her progress. (Figure
15.3 presents these results). We have found that
more frequent measurement in lengthier psychotherapy
proves unnecessary and frequently annoys patients.
In most sessions, Amber will rate her urges to drink,
drug, gamble, and shoplift in the last week on a 11point
visual analogue scale, where 0 = None and 10 =
The worst.

In terms of treatment and relationship satisfaction,
we typically rely on asking direct questions of clients
following the scoring and review of the measures of
symptom outcome. These begin with broad, open-ended
questions, such as “How is the psychotherapy going?
How are we (the relationship) doing?” Then we follow
up with more focused inquiries as the patient’s responses
and situations dictate. For Amber, these might
be on the order of “What has been the most help so
far? The least helpful? How are we doing on honoring
your preferences? Do you experience me being directive
enough and providing enough tools? How can we
improve things?”

Several standardized measures are available for assessing
two or more of these crucial areas: the COM-
PASS (Lueger et al., 2001), the Clinical Outcomes in
Routine Evaluation (CORE) system (widely used in the
United Kingdom; Barkham et al., 2001), the Partners
for Change Outcome Management System (PCOMS;
Miller, Duncan, Sorrell, & Brown, 2005), and the Outcome
Questionnaire–45 (OQ-45; Lambert et al., 2004).
Our favorite, the Innerlife STS system (www.innerlife.
com), provides both clinician and client versions, and
offers both pretreatment and across-treatment information.
The important point here is not the particular outcome
monitoring system but that the therapist regularly
collects the information. For novice therapists unaccustomed
to asking these questions, particularly those
related to treatment and relationship satisfaction, we
strongly encourage the use of the formal measurement
systems.

Treatment Process

Having now created a sufficiently empathic alliance,
collected sufficient diagnostic and transdiagnostic information
to create a treatment plan, and prepared the
patient, we proceed in the fourth session to conducting
CBT for depression and relapse prevention.


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

The CBT follows a fairly standard protocol: The patient
is oriented to the cognitive model of depression,
guided in identifying depressogenic thoughts, asked to
record those thoughts between sessions, and instructed
in challenging and disputing those thoughts, replacing
them with healthier attributions and coping statements.
The patient also agrees to behavioral activation: getting
out of her home for at least 3 hours a day initially
(graduating to 6 hours later in therapy) and volunteering
4 hours a week (eventually progressing to 15 hours
a week). Amber is presented with a list of psychologistrecommended
and research-supported self-help books
on depression (Norcross et al., 2013), and decides to
read Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy (Burns,
1999). She later decides to purchase the accompanying
workbook and often brings it to session to review the
worksheets.

We devote about half of the session time to the CBT
for her depression and the other half to relapse prevention
(RP) for her drinking, drugging, shoplifting, and
gambling. Amber has become aware in her AA meetings
that relapse is the most common long-term outcome
in the treatment of addictions. More urgently,
Amber feels the pressure of returning to prison if she is
found taking drugs or shoplifting.

RP is self-management training designed to avoid
recycling and to enhance the maintenance stage (Marlatt
& Donovan, 2007). Through in-session discussions
and between-session readings, Amber is taught how to
understand relapse as a process, identify high-risk situations,
learn to cope with cravings to engage in the addictive
behavior, and achieve a balanced lifestyle. Her
riskiest triggers pertain to inactivity, negative mood
states, and a particular subset of friends. Fortunately,
the first two of these are being fruitfully addressed by
the CBT for her depression. A lot of time in session
is spent on actualizing the “avoid people, places, and
things” slogan of her AA meetings to minimize time
spent with those friends. We also practice and rehearse
urge-surfing for those times when, in spite of avoiding
the triggers, Amber confronts the cravings.

As an eager computer user, Amber decides to search
the Web for research reviews on RP and finds a metaanalysis
(which she understandably does not fully comprehend)
on its effectiveness in 26 studies representing
a sample of 9,504 patients (Irvin, Bowers, Dunn,
& Wang, 1999). The results reveal that RP is generally
effective, certainly more so than no-treatment controls,
and particularly effective for alcohol and polysub


stance use disorders. “Just like me,” Amber smilingly
acknowledges in session.

In one session, the 13th or 14th, Amber appears uncharacteristically
reticent to participate in the therapeutic
work. I ask about her interest, and she unconvincingly
responds, “Oh, I’m just tired today.” The pattern
persists into the next session:

tHeraPist: You do not seem into it [psychotherapy]
today. It seems different to me, like last week. Not as
much energy and zip like we usually have. What are
you experiencing or feeling in session of late?

amBer: Well .. . I don’t know .. . feeling annoyed.

tHeraPist: Thanks for telling me. I realize that’s a
hard thing for you to do—voicing your annoyance,
disappointment, with someone. Good for you.

amBer: It’s hard .. . (about a 30-second pause) Last
time [session] I think that you did not understand
how hard I have been working to do all of these
things. You seemed critical of me like I’m not doing
enough.

tHeraPist: You’re feeling that I am not appreciating
your hard work, in psychotherapy and at home, and
that I’m critical of your efforts .. ..

amBer: Yeah, that’s right. But now I’m afraid that I’m
disappointing you or making you angry .. .

tHeraPist: Certainly not, Amber. I’m feeling the opposite:
I’m pleased and proud that you took the risk
of being assertive and telling me how you feel today.
That’s a wonderful way for us to be, but not wonderful
feelings inside you. Huh?

Amber concurs that these are troubling feelings for
her: Assertion triggers her fear of rejection or abandonment.
When I inquire when she has felt this way
before, she immediately says—literally, immediately,
speaking before I finish the question—“my father.”
That leads into an extended process of Amber speaking
about how she perceives her father to be supportive
in his remarks but critical and unaccepting of her in
his behavior. Without prompting, she observes, “Ohh.
That’s what I am saying now about you.. ..”

At the end of her psychotherapy, Amber and I both
nominated this session as a memorable turning point
for her. She found her voice to express her displeasure
with me—a male authority figure—and discovered that
she was transferring or projecting feelings originally
associated with her father to me (and probably others).


Depression and Substance Abuse

It is quite possible that an empathic failure or a neutral
look on my part sparked her feeling, but the underlying
feelings certainly belonged to her father.

Beyond that self-awareness, this session also solidified
our relationship in that it demonstrated in vivo a
way for us to repair any ruptures in the alliance (Safran,
Muran, & Eubanks-Carter, 2011). The therapist
can respond nondefensively, attend emphatically and
directly to the relationship, understand the mutual dynamics,
adjust behavior (if necessary), and attend to
the patient’s conflictual relationship pattern. In several
studies, rupture repair positively predicts treatment outcome
(Safran et al., 2011). At the end of session, Amber
said that she experienced “like a breakthrough,” and I
felt that is was one of the good moments in our work.

In approximately 20 to 22 sessions, Amber is less depressed.
Her BDI-II score has been cut in half (Figure
15.3), and her suicidal ideation has disappeared. Her
urges to use are down to 0–2, accompanied by no slips
in drugging, drinking, gambling, or shoplifting.

Brimming with a new-found confidence and a genuine
trust in the process, Amber is ready to address her
anxiety and PTSD. However, she remains conflicted
and fearful. “Depression” is her favored term, and understanding
“anxiety” is novel and unsettling.

There are many therapeutic means to address ambivalence
and resistance, of course, but I select motivational
interviewing (MI) for Amber. MI fits our therapeutic
relationship, matches Amber’s contemplation stage,
and comes with impressive research support for large
effects in a small number of sessions (Hettema, Steele,
& Miller, 2005). MI expands on person-centered therapy
by providing specific methods to move the patient
toward behavior change (Miller & Rollnick, 2002).
Following the guiding spirit of MI, I try to:

••
Express empathy by using reflective listening to

convey understanding of Amber’s ambivalence

about tacking the anxiety problem and PTSD, and

to communicate my respect for her need for self


preservation.

••
Develop discrepancy between Amber’s convic


tion that she suffers only from depression and sub


stance abuse, and the clinical findings that she also

experiences high anxiety.

••
Roll with resistance by meeting it with reflection

and curiosity rather than confrontation.

••
Support self-efficacy by actively conveying the

message that the client is capable of change.

MI leverages the inherent energy that resistance
brings to the therapeutic interaction, seeking to redirect
it in a manner that avoids a rupture in the therapeutic
relationship and allows the emergence of client
change talk. Just as a canoeist would probably not
paddle upstream against a strong current, so, too, the
motivational interviewer does not argue with clients.
Instead, I roll with the resistance by using the energy
in the client to steer the interaction (Moyers & Rollnick,
2002).

MI is used to enhance Amber’s intrinsic motivation
to change and to explore and resolve her ambivalence.
After three sessions of primarily MI methods, Amber
opts to confront her anxiety and PTSD. Just as Carl
Rogers predicted, clients can go a long way in a short
time when provided with facilitative conditions, an
accepting therapist, and considerable autonomy. MI’s
flexibility of use permits it to be integrated into other
psychotherapies to reduce client ambivalence and to
minimize their resistance (Miller & Moyers, 2005).

The majority of session time now focuses on treating
Amber’s anxiety-fueled avoidance and her prison-related
PTSD. The cognitive restructuring for depression has
already prepared her for the cognitive work of exposure
therapy in her daily life. Amber decides initially to target
her fear of speaking in AA meetings and driving on
highways. In order to promote her choice and autonomy, I
ask Amber to read descriptions of two leading treatments
for PTSD: prolonged exposure with response prevention
and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
(EMDR). After doing so, Amber elects to try the EMDR,
reasoning that whereas prolonged exposure requires extensive
daily homework, EMDR does not.

Simultaneously, she begins to read Getting Past
Your Past (Shapiro, 2012), a recent self-help book by
EMDR’s developer. When Amber mentions this to me,
I congratulate her for taking the initiative, and then
somewhat sheepishly admit that I should have thought
of recommending it to her when she expressed interest
in self-help materials. In an exchange that Amber
nominated at the end of her therapy as a pivotal moment,
she smiles and cautions me against thinking in
terms of “shoulds.” I laugh for a full minute, barely able
to contain myself, congratulate her on mastering cognitive
therapy, then observe that the “student is becoming
the master.” Amber responds deadpan, “Yes, grasshopper”—
an allusion to an old television series (favored
by her father!) in which the seasoned master calls the
eager student “grasshopper.”


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

We introduce breathing exercises and practice selfsoothing
skills before undertaking the EMDR proper.
Amber then undergoes five elongated sessions (90 minutes)
of EMDR to address a series of traumatic events
during her incarceration. Amber tolerates the sessions
well and successfully uses the breathing and selfsoothing
between sessions for a couple of nightmares
and daytime flashbacks. Her anxiety noticeably drops,
as do her subjective units of distress (SUDs) ascribed
to the traumatic events. At the conclusion of the five
EMDR sessions, the SUDS are 1 or 2 for each event,
which she deems ecologically valid.

Meanwhile, the exposure to speaking in AA meetings
and highway driving continues successfully.
Amber participates verbally in a frequency of the “average
person,” which is her goal. Driving on the highway
at or above the posted speed limit becomes “no big
deal anymore.” Quite apart from accomplishing these
goals, Amber learns the larger lesson that avoidance
reduces anxiety in the short run but brings far more
misery in the long run.

The in vivo exposure work continues but occupies
less of our attention in session as Amber now tackles
the amorphous borderline personality disorder. Amber
and I begin slowly and didactically with education about
her unassertive, approval-seeking style through bibliotherapy.
I offer a selection of assertion and borderline
personality self-help resources rated highly by mental
health professionals (Norcross et al., 2013), again asking
Amber to choose actively instead of passively accepting
a prescription. She selects not one but three: Your Perfect
Right (Alberti & Emmons, 1995), Sometimes I Act
Crazy (Kreisman & Straus, 2006) for her parents, and
Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality
Disorder (Linehan, 1993b) for herself.

We begin with assertion training in the behavioral
and feminist traditions: exploring differences between
assertion and aggression; cognitive restructuring for
her guilt and fear of rejection when assertive; examining
gender scripts in her family and in society about
power; role-playing specific responses in session; taperecording
Amber during role plays to fine-tune her
voice and words; and jointly developing homework
assignments with family members. Assertion is a goal
not only outside therapy but within it as well. I remind
Amber of our compact several months earlier when we
agreed that she would move forward and take more
control over the work. She agrees, and I chuckle as I
remind her, “I am the grasshopper now.”

Amber’s underlying identity or schema as inadequate
is now more fully explored. It is difficult to summarize
the constellation of intersecting therapy methods used
for our final 20 sessions—emotional processing, cognitive
restructuring, assertion training, transference interpretations,
and active practice. The emotion-focused
work follows in the experiential tradition, including a
few two-chair dialogues between Amber’s competent
part and her inadequate part. The exercise provide, in
Amber’s words, “clarity—I can really see how they
clash and result in strange behavior.” Her symptoms
continue to fade away.

Amber’s emerging self is now confronted with endless
choices in her life and in therapy. Should she secure
employment? What about her love life? Would graduate
school make sense? What would she like to tackle in
therapy? I participate in these discussions, of course,
but ultimately Amber will decide, knowing that I support
Amber and her decisions.

By way of summary, here is how Amber courageously
tackles these life challenges. She decides
to continue her volunteer work (now at 20 hours per
week) and to pursue part-time employment. Submitting
job applications forces her to explain her legal and addiction
travails, which prompts considerable anxiety,
but she successfully avoids the avoidant pull and does
so. She obtains part-time employment. Amber begins
to date casually and decides that she is not ready yet
for a romantic commitment; she is charmed that several
men ask to date her and two of them seek something
“deeper.” She will make that decision “in time—when I
am ready.” She explores several career options with the
assistance of a vocational interest inventory I administer
and, like many clients engaged in psychotherapy
and AA, decides to reorient her career trajectory to a
human service field. Finally, the cumulative work on
assertion deficits and borderline personality disorder
prompts Amber to create different boundaries with her
parents and to invite them in for a few conjoint sessions
to renegotiate a competent adult to competent adult
connection, in contradistinction to years of parent–
crazy child relating.

Fifty or so sessions into the psychotherapy, Amber
notes, “We have not rated my urges [to drink, drug,
gamble, shoplift] lately.” I reflect for a moment and respond,
“There does not seem to be any need to do so,
is there?” We mutually decide to recognize Amber’s
progress by changing from weekly sessions to sessions
every 2 or 3 weeks.


Depression and Substance Abuse

As psychotherapy winds down, and as Amber consolidates
and internalizes her progress, my mind turns
to her future. I gently suggest that the best protection
against slipping back into depression, substance abuse,
avoidance, anxiety, and patterns of inadequacy is selfnurturance.
Amber thinks on this for a few weeks, then
at our next session presents a self-nurturance list. This
includes reducing her cigarette smoking, continuing
her AA attendance and physical exercise, and a host of
assertive and social pursuits.

Maintenance or booster sessions are indicated when
the problems are complex, when addictions are present,
when the patient is highly impaired, and when a personality
disorder is present. Those features certainly
apply to Amber, at least the “old Amber,” and constitute
strong indicators of the tendency to relapse. For these
reasons, Amber and I decide on a schedule of monthly
maintenance sessions for several months.
