Couple Distress

cause they imply blame. It is the combination of “pain
and blame” that results in discord. But if the therapist
can encourage partners to express their pain without
expressing blame, the result may be increased acceptance
from the other partner. IBCT therapists often encourage
soft disclosures by suggesting “soft” feelings,
such as the fear, hurt, and shame that may underlie each
partner’s behavior. Although soft disclosures are more
difficult to make because they reveal vulnerability, they
are easier for the other partner to hear and arouse more
empathy. Thus, empathic joining is promoted by (1) reformulation
of a couple’s discord as a result of partners’
common differences and their understandable emotional
reactions to those differences, and (2) the use
of soft disclosures to express painful emotions. These
disclosures can come through interaction between the
therapist and each partner or the therapist can prompt
the partners to make these disclosures directly to each
other, increasing the emotional intensity of the disclosure
and allowing the partners to have the conversation
they did not have but could have had (Wile, 2008).

UnifieD DeTACHMenT froM THe ProBleM

This IBCT technique allows partners to “step back”
from their problems and describe them without placing
blame—or responsibility for change—on either
partner. In this way, partners engage in “unified detachment”
from their problems. This strategy can be
used to engage a couple in a DEEP discussion about
their Differences (how these differences resulted from
their backgrounds), their Emotional sensitivities (what
past experiences may have understandably led to these
sensitivities), their External stressors (how these stressors
came to be), and their Patterns of interaction (how
each interacts in ways that make sense from his/her
perspective). However, most often it is used to help the
couple understand, accept, and eventually alter their
Patterns of interaction. For example, the therapist may
engage partners in a dialogue in which they use nonjudgmental
terms to describe the sequence of a particular
conflict, including what factors typically trigger
their reactions, how specific events are connected to
one another, and how they can defuse or override the
conflict in the future. The approach is an intellectual
analysis of the problem that is described in an emotionally
detached manner as a third-party “it” rather than
in terms of “you” or “me.” When possible, the therapist
should give the couple’s theme, pattern of interaction,
or mutual trap a name, and use this to define the prob


lem further as an “it.” By detaching themselves from
the problem, partners have an opportunity to discuss
their conflict without becoming emotionally “charged”
by it. In this way, they can try to understand the conflict
from a more neutral, objective stance. They engage in
a kind of joint mindfulness about their problem. The
therapist can also use metaphor and humor to distance
the couple emotionally from the problem, as long as the
humor does not in any way belittle either partner.

TolerAnCe BUilDing

Building acceptance may be most challenging when
one partner experiences intense emotional pain as a
result of the other partner’s behavior. In these circumstances,
the IBCT therapist must help one partner build
tolerance for the other partner’s “offending” behavior.
By building tolerance, the partner ideally experiences a
reduction in the pain caused by the behavior. To build
tolerance, however, the partner must cease efforts to
prevent, avoid, or escape the “offending” partner’s behavior.
Instead, by exposing him/herself to the behavior
without the associated struggle, the partner reduces
his/her sensitivity to the behavior and, ideally, experiences
the “offending” behavior as less painful.

One strategy for building tolerance is through “positive
reemphasis,” or focusing on the positive aspects
of a partner’s negative behavior. This strategy may
be relatively easy when a negative behavior is in some
way related to a quality the partner once found attractive
about the other. For example, what she sees as her
partner’s “uptightness” might be the “stability” that
first attracted her. Alternatively, what he sees as her
“flakiness” or “irresponsibility” might be the “freespiritedness”
or “rebelliousness” that so attracted him
in the beginning of their relationship. The positive reemphasis
does not deny the negative qualities of the
behavior in question, but it helps partners gain the perspective
that any quality often has both good and bad
features.

Another strategy for building tolerance for differences
is to focus on the ways these differences complement
each other, and to present these differences as part of
what makes the relationship “work.” One partner’s stability
might balance the other’s free-spiritedness. The
therapist might describe for the partners the ways they
would be “worse off” if those differences did not exist.
The differences can become a positive aspect of the relationship,
something in which the partners take pride
rather than something they see as a destructive threat.


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

A third technique for building tolerance to a partner’s
behavior is to prepare couples for inevitable slipups
and lapses in behavior. This is especially important
when the partners first begin to detect changes in their
behavior and begin to feel positive about the progress
they are making in therapy. It is during this time that
the therapist should congratulate them for their hard
work and progress, then warn them that “backsliding”
is still a likely occurrence. The partners should be
asked to imagine some of the circumstances in which
a slipup is likely to occur, and to consider possible responses
to the slipup in advance. Working out how they
will face such lapses helps partners build their tolerance
for them.

A related strategy for building tolerance is to instruct
couples to fake negative behavior while they are in session
or at home. Each partner is instructed to engage in
a designated “bad behavior”—with the stipulation that
he/she is to engage in this behavior only when he/she
does not feel like doing so. The instructions are given
to the couple, so that each partner knows that a bad behavior
he/she is about to witness in session or may see
in the future might actually be faked. Ideally this introduces
an ambiguity about future negative behaviors
that may mitigate the partner’s emotional response to
them. More importantly, however, is that faking behavior
gives both partners an opportunity to observe the
effects of their negative behavior on the other. Specifically,
because they are performing the “bad behavior”
during a time when they do not feel like it, they make
these observations when they are in a calm emotional
state that allows them to be more sympathetic. When
done in session, the therapist can help debrief the reactions
to the “bad” behavior. When done at home, the
faker is instructed to let the other partner know about
the faked behavior soon after is it performed, so the
situation does not escalate and the partners have an opportunity
to “debrief” following their “experiment.”

One unavoidable source of pain for many partners
is the feeling that the other fails to meet their needs in
some important way. However, rarely is a partner able
to fulfill all of the needs of the other. An important aspect
of acceptance building is for partners to increase
their own self-reliance, or self-care, in getting their
needs met. They should be encouraged to find alternative
ways to care for themselves when their partners are
not able to do so. Partners may need to learn to seek
support from friends and family in times of stress, or
to find new ways to define and solve a problem on their
own. As their self-reliance increases, reliance on part


ners to meet all of their emotional needs decreases.
Ideally, this results in decreased sensitivity to their
partners’ failure to meet their needs, thereby reducing
conflict.

Traditional Strategies for Promoting Change

For some couples, change interventions may be indicated.
Whether an IBCT therapist begins by implementing
“acceptance” rather than “change” techniques depends
primarily on the couple’s collaborative set and the partners’
specific treatment needs. In general, however,
change techniques are most effective if implemented
later in therapy, after acceptance work has been done.
Often acceptance work is sufficient for bringing about
change by itself: Once the collaborative set is restored
through acceptance, the couple is able to bring about
change by applying skills and strategies they already
possess. In these situations, no deliberate change strategies
need to be employed.

BeHAVior exCHAnge

The primary goal of behavior exchange (BE) is to increase
the proportion of a couple’s daily positive behaviors
and interactions. These techniques are instigative,
in that they are intended to increase each partner’s performance
of positive behaviors. Because BE requires a
great deal of collaboration between partners, it is best
implemented later in therapy, after acceptance work
has been done. In addition to using BE to increase
a couple’s positive interactions, the IBCT therapist
should also consider BE a diagnostic tool for assessing
possible areas in need of more acceptance work.

The three basic steps in BE are (1) to identify behaviors
that each partner can do for the other that would
increase relationship satisfaction, (2) to increase the
frequency of those behaviors in the couple’s daily behavioral
repertoire, and (3) to debrief the experience
of providing and receiving positive behaviors. Partners
are often given a homework assignment to generate a
list of actions to do for the other to increase his/her satisfaction.
Partners are instructed not to discuss these
lists with each other to reduce the threat of criticism
from the other and to keep each partner focused on
his/her own assignment. In the next session, partners’
lists are reviewed and discussed. Their next assignment
might be to perform one or more of the actions on the
list during the next week, but they are not to tell the
partner which action they are performing. In the sub



Couple Distress

sequent therapy session, partners review the success of
their assignment and whether it had the desired effect
on the other. The list can be modified to eliminate items
that do not seem to have an effect, and in later sessions
each partner can elicit feedback from the other to optimize
the benefit of the actions on the list.

CoMMUniCATion TrAining

Although many couples are effective communicators
without having had any formal “training,” poor communication
may exacerbate or even cause many problems
for distressed couples. In their attempts to get
the other to change, partners may resort to maladaptive
communication tactics such as coercion (crying,
threatening, withholding affection). Although coercion
may be effective in the short term, in that the other
may eventually comply with the demand, the use of
coercion is likely to escalate such that increasingly coercive
tactics are required to achieve the desired effect.
Also, coercion tends to beget coercion, so that coercion
by one partner leads to coercion by the other. The inevitable
result of such interactions is that partners become
extremely polarized. The goal of communication
and problem-solving training is to teach couples how
to discuss their problems and to negotiate change without
resorting to such destructive tactics. Ideally, these
skills will be useful to couples even after therapy has
ended.

As part of communication training, couples are
taught both “speaker” and “listener” skills. To become
more effective “speakers,” couples are instructed to (1)
focus on the self by expressing “I statements”; (2) focus
on expressing emotional reactions, such as “I feel disappointed
. . . ” or “I feel angry . . . ”; and (3) focus on
the partner’s specific behaviors that lead to emotional
reactions, such as “I feel disappointed when you don’t
call me when you are away.” To become more effective
listeners, partners are instructed to paraphrase and reflect
what the other has just said. Paraphrasing ensures
that neither partner is being misread during the conversation,
and it decreases the tendency to jump to conclusions
about what is being said, in addition to generally
slowing down the interaction.

Once partners have been given some instruction in
these communication skills, they are directed to use
these skills in practice conversations in the therapy
session. Communicating with these guidelines may
feel awkward during practice conversations, so therapists
should try to adapt the guidelines to the couple’s

style of conversation and explain that following the
guidelines will feel more natural with increased use.
The therapist should be prepared to interrupt and make
corrections if the partners deviate from the guidelines
and engage in destructive communication. The therapist
should provide the couple with feedback after each
practice session, and the exercise should be adequately
debriefed. When the therapist is confident that the partners
have improved their in-session communication
skills, he/she then encourages them to practice these
skills as homework.

These basic communication skills often enable partners
to share their feelings with one another and to discuss
difficult issues that arise, such as when one partner
gets upset with the other’s action. However, sometimes
partners need to do more than share feelings or debrief
an event. They need to solve an upcoming or recurrent
problem, which is the purpose of problem-solving communication
skills.

ProBleM‑solVing TrAining

Often what is more damaging in partners’ struggles
around daily problems than the problems themselves is
their destructive attempts to solve them. These attempts
may begin with an accusation by one partner, which is
met by defensiveness and anger from the other. Soon
the argument may escalate to counterblaming and character
assassination—and the problem itself gets lost in
the conflict around it. In problem-solving training, couples
are taught to have constructive problem-solving
discussions while employing three sets of skills: problem
definition skills, problem solution skills, and structuring
skills.

First, partners are taught to define the problem as
specifically as possible by specifying the behavior of
concern and the circumstances surrounding it. Partners
are encouraged to describe some of the emotions they
experience as a result of the problem, in an effort to
increase emotional acceptance. Finally, both partners
are asked to define their respective roles in perpetuating
the problem.

Once the problem has been defined, the couple can
begin working toward problem solution. The first step
in problem solution is brainstorming, in which the
couple tries to come up with as many solutions to the
problem as possible. The couple is told that any and
all solutions may be considered, even impossible or
silly ones. Immediate evaluative comments about the
brainstormed solutions are discouraged, and discus



CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

sions of which options are actually viable are held off
for later. Suggestions are written down so that they can
be reviewed later. This exercise can be lighthearted and
playful, often generating positive affect during the session.
After the list has been generated, the couple goes
through the list, eliminating those suggestions that are
obviously impossible, silly, or unlikely to be effective.
After the list is pruned, each item is considered for its
potential to solve the problem. For each item, the couple
considers the pros and cons, and the list is further modified,
until a final list of options has been generated. The
remaining items are used to formulate a possible solution
to the problem. The agreement that is made about
this solution is written down and sometimes signed by
each partner. Finally, the couple is asked to consider
any obstacles to executing the agreement, and to work
out strategies for combating these. The partners are told
to post the agreement in a place where they both can
see it often, and a date is set to review their progress in
solving the problem. During the next few sessions, the
therapist checks in with them on their progress, and the
agreement may be renegotiated, if necessary.

Finally, the partners learn structuring skills for their
problem-solving discussions. They structure these discussions
by setting aside a specific time and place to
have them. They are also instructed not to discuss the
problem at the “scene of the crime,” that is, to hold off
discussing a problem until the designated time. Finally,
the couple is instructed to focus on only one problem
at a time. Throughout their problem-solving discussions,
partners are asked to follow the basic guidelines
of paraphrasing each other’s statements, and to avoid
both negative inferences about each other’s intent, and
negative verbal and nonverbal communication.

The couple’s first attempts at using these problemsolving
skills should occur in session, under the supervision
of the therapist. But after the partners have
practiced and received feedback about their problemsolving
skills, they are encouraged to apply these techniques
at home to help them discuss and negotiate their
problems.

In implementing these behavior change skills, the
IBCT therapist tries to adapt them to the particular
needs of the couple. For example, if a couple finds it
helpful to go back and forth between definition and solution
while discussing a problem, the therapist would
eliminate the guideline specifying that the problem be
carefully defined before solutions are considered. Or if
a couple finds it distracting to generate silly or impossible
solutions, the therapist would not encourage that.

The therapist also tries to adapt these strategies to the
formulation for the couple. For example, if the closeness
seeker tends to dominate discussions and make
proposals for solving a problem about time together,
while the independence seeker tends to withdraw from
the discussion, the therapist might shift the focus on
problem solving to the independence seeker.

Therapist and Client Variables Relevant
to IBCT

As in any therapy, it is important that IBCT therapists
maintain a nonjudgmental stance toward their clients.
But in the context of IBCT, it is particularly important
that the therapist practice acceptance with both partners
in the same way that partners are asked to practice
acceptance with one another. The IBCT therapist must
validate the experiences and responses of both partners,
and find ways to develop empathy and compassion
for them no matter how challenging this may be.

In addition to practicing acceptance, it is important
that IBCT therapists listen carefully to couples’
in-session interactions and look for the functions of
their various problematic behaviors. IBCT therapists
must be particularly attentive to subtle verbal and
nonverbal cues that may be relevant to the formulation
of couples’ problems. IBCT therapists must also
be prepared to abandon any prescribed agenda to address
the immediate needs of the couple at any given
time. When destructive interactions occur in session,
the IBCT therapist must not only be able to maintain
a nonconfrontational demeanor but also stop the interaction
effectively. Other important IBCT skills include
using couples’ language and jargon when making interventions.
Finally, it is not a goal of IBCT therapists to
“cheerlead” for the success of the relationship; rather,
they create an environment in which couples can experience
the hope of finding a different way of being, and
safely discuss and evaluate their own relationships.

The Efficacy of IBCT

Three studies attest to the efficacy of IBCT—two small
pilot investigations and one major outcome study.
Wimberly (1998) randomly assigned eight couples to a
group format of IBCT and nine couples to a waiting-list
control group, and found superior results for the IBCT
couples. Jacobson, Christensen, Prince, Cordova, and
Eldridge (2000) randomly assigned 21 couples to either
IBCT or TBCT. At the end of treatment, 80% of


Couple Distress

couples who had received IBCT showed clinically significant
improvements in relationship satisfaction compared
to 64% of couples who received TBCT.

To date, the largest study of couple therapy in general
and of IBCT in particular was reported by Christensen
and colleagues (2004). In a two-site clinical
trial conducted at UCLA and the University of Washington,
Christensen and colleagues randomly assigned
134 seriously and chronically distressed couples to
either IBCT or TBCT. Couples received a maximum
of 26 sessions of couple therapy delivered by professional
PhD-level therapists, who provided both IBCT
and TBCT treatments and were carefully supervised
in both. Adherence and competence data provided evidence
that treatments were delivered as expected. At
termination, 70% of IBCT couples and 61% of TBCT
couples had clinically significant improvements in relationship
satisfaction. Pre- to posttreatment effect sizes
on marital satisfaction were d = 0.90 for IBCT and d =

0.71 for TBCT (see Christensen, Atkins, Baucom, &
Yi, 2010) Although the termination results were not
significantly different, the trajectory of change was different
for both IBCT and TBCT couples. IBCT couples
improved steadily in satisfaction throughout treatment,
but TBCT couples improved more rapidly early on in
treatment, with their gains flattening out more than
those of IBCT couples later in treatment.
Atkins and colleagues (2005) examined the predictors
of response to treatment in the previous study. A
variety of interpersonal variables, such as quality of
communication, predicted the initial status of couples,
but precious few variables predicted change from intake
to termination. Couples who were married longer
showed greater improvements in satisfaction, and exploratory
analyses indicated that sexually dissatisfied
couples showed slower initial gains but overall more
consistent gains in IBCT than in TBCT.

Doss, Thum, Sevier, Atkins, and Christensen (2005)
analyzed the mechanisms of change in this study of couple
therapy. Early in therapy, changes in the frequency
of targeted behaviors were associated with increases
in satisfaction for both treatment conditions. However,
later in therapy, changes in the acceptance of targeted
behaviors were associated with increases in satisfaction
for both treatment conditions. TBCT generated
significantly greater increases than IBCT in targeted
behaviors early in treatment. However, IBCT generated
significantly greater increases in the acceptance of targeted
behaviors throughout treatment. Thus, the study
validated some of the putative mechanisms of change

and differences between the treatments in their impact
on these mechanisms.

Subsequently, studies have examined these couples
over follow-up: Christensen, Atkins, Yi, Baucom, and
George (2006) looked at relationship satisfaction data
in couples every 6 months over a 2-year follow-up; Baucom,
Sevier, Eldridge, Doss, and Christensen (2011)
looked at observational data at 2-year follow-up; and
Christensen and colleagues (2010) examined relationship
satisfaction and relationship status approximately
every 6 months over a 5-year follow-up. Couples generally
maintained their treatment gains in satisfaction
over 2 years, and IBCT couples had significantly superior
relationship satisfaction compared to TBCT
couples at each time point during the first 2 years of
follow-up. Although TBCT couples, having been
trained explicitly in communication, showed greater
improvements in observed communication at termination
than IBCT couples (Sevier, Eldridge, Jones, Doss,
& Christensen, 2008), IBCT couples showed greater
maintenance of gains over 2 years (Baucom et al.,
2011). Over the subsequent 3 years, couples lost some
of their gains, and results from IBCT and TBCT converged.
At 5-year follow-up, results for marital satisfaction
relative to pretreatment revealed effect sizes of d =

1.03 for IBCT and d = 0.92 for TBCT; 50.0% of IBCT
couples and 45.9% of TBCT couples showed clinically
significant improvement. Relationship status, obtained
on all 134 couples, revealed that 25.7% of IBCT couples
and 27.9% of TBCT couples were separated or divorced.
None of these findings at 5-year follow-up were
statistically significant. These follow-up data compared
favorably to other, long-term results of couple therapy.
Baucom, Atkins, Simpson, and Christensen (2009)
examined predictors of 2-year follow-up. As in the
earlier prediction study, there were few predictors of
outcome. Perhaps because of greater commitment,
length of marriage predicted better outcomes at 2-year
follow-up. Two objective predictor variables not used
in the earlier prediction study were used here: a measure
of arousal obtained from voice recordings during
the observational data, and measures of influence tactics
obtained through linguistic analysis of transcribed
observational data. Using these measures, moderately
distressed couples in which the wife had lower levels
of arousal during problem-solving discussions and in
which hard influence tactics (that give the partner little
room to respond) were used less frequently tended to
perform better in treatment than moderately distressed
couples with higher levels of arousal or those who used


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

more hard influence tactics. Couples in IBCT tended
to do better than their counterparts in TBCT when the
wife had higher levels of arousal and when couples
used soft influence tactics. Clearly these findings need
to be replicated, However, it may be that the strategies
of IBCT, which emphasize emotional expression, work
better than TBCT strategies when there is high emotional
arousal and when partners are more open to influence.


It is important to note that this sample, although designed
to include seriously and chronically distressed
couples, excluded couples in which one or both partners
were experiencing bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
or serious suicidality; met criteria for current drug or
alcohol abuse or dependence; met criteria for borderline,
antisocial, or schizotypal personality disorders; or
had a history of severe physical violence. The rationale
for these exclusionary criteria is that for such individuals,
a primary treatment other than couple therapy is
likely to be indicated. However, the sample did not exclude
couples in which one or both partners suffered
from other psychological disorders, such as anxiety or
depression. The rationale for including these couples is
that their relationship can still be treated despite partners
having such individual problems. Furthermore,
some of the couples’ relationship problems may even
be contributing to these individual problems. Thus,
preliminary data suggest that IBCT can be successfully
applied to many couples, including those in which a
partner has certain other psychological disorders. For
example, the preceding predictor studies found that indices
of mental illness, including Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV diagnoses, were not related to
improvements during couple therapy. Furthermore, Atkins,
Dimidjian, Bedics, and Christensen (2009) found
that depression in this sample improved as relationship
satisfaction improved.

Ongoing research with this sample will examine in
greater detail the process of couple therapy, potential
mechanisms of change as they relate to 5-year outcome,
and predictors of 5-year outcome. Apart from research
on this particular sample, additional research is being
done to expand the reach of IBCT. Brian Doss and
Andrew Christensen have adapted IBCT for an online
treatment and with support from the National Institute
of Child Health and Development are testing the efficacy
of this treatment. Also, IBCT has been chosen
as one of the evidence-based treatments that the U.S.
Veteran’s Administration (VA) is implementing nation


wide. VA therapists throughout the country are being
given intensive training that involves several days of
workshop followed by 6 months of weekly supervision
as therapists see two or more couples using IBCT. A
trained IBCT consultant listens to therapists’ recorded
sessions; therapists must reach proficiency on a rating
scale of IBCT criteria in order to complete the training
program successfully. Program evaluation data are
being collected as part of that work, and initial results
suggest positive outcomes for IBCT with this VA population
of couples. For additional information on IBCT,
including access to online research articles and a national
database of therapists trained in the approach,
see ibct.psych.ucla.edu.

case stuDy

We use the case example of Anne and Mark2 to demonstrate
the application of IBCT. We have included excerpts
from the assessment and feedback sessions, in
addition to treatment sessions selected for their effective
use of IBCT acceptance-building interventions.3

Anne and Mark were a middle-aged couple married
for 10 years at treatment onset. Anne had three children
from her previous marriage.

Assessment

Session 1

After greetings and introductions, Anne and Mark’s
therapist (Dr. S) began Session 1 by orienting them to
the assessment process as follows:

“We’ll be working together for the next 25 sessions.
You have already done the first step of the assessment
process by completing all of those questionnaires.
Your next three visits, including today, will
be the second step of the assessment phase. Today
I’m meeting with the two of you to get to know you,
to hear about your relationship . . . as you share some
of the history about meeting and dating, and bring
us up until today. Then over the next two visits, I’d
like to meet with the two of you individually. After
that, at the fourth visit, I’ll give you feedback. That’s
where I’ll put together all of the information from
the questionnaires and our time together today, as
well as our time individually, to paint a picture to


Couple Distress

present some understanding of what could be going
on.”

Particularly if the couple expresses hesitation or ambivalence
about being in therapy, the therapist should
include the following:

“This assessment period is also your opportunity to
get to know me and the kind of therapy we’ll be
doing, so that you can get a feeling for whether this is
going to be a good match for your needs right now.”

After checking in with Anne and Mark to see whether
they understood this explanation, Dr. S elicited from
them a brief description of their presenting problems:

“Before we get into your history, maybe you could
give me a sense of some of the problems that have
been going on that led you to decide, “Let’s get some
help.”

After Mark and Anne took turns describing their
sides of the problems in the relationship, Dr. S gathered
the couple’s developmental history, using probing
phrases such as the following:

“Let’s start at the beginning. Why don’t you tell me
where and how the two of you met?”

“Mark, what was it about Anne that attracted you
initially? What about you, Anne?”

“Anne, how could you tell that Mark was interested
in you? . . . What kinds of things did he say? . . .
How did you flirt with him? Which one of you
made the first move?”

“When you decided to go from living together to getting
married, how did that happen?”

In the course of their description, Anne and Mark
had many opportunities to say complimentary things
about each other. Mark described Anne as sensual,
a quality that he found very attractive, and Anne described
Mark as very nice and easygoing. Dr. S was
very thorough and specific when eliciting details of
Mark and Anne’s behavior during courtship, such as
the fact that both partners agreed that their first kiss
was very good.

Even during this part of the assessment phase, opportunities
for building acceptance may present them


selves. At one point during Session 1, Anne made a soft
disclosure when she discussed a time when she had
initially rejected Mark (who had asked her to dance).
Anne said that when Mark did not get angry with her
after she rejected him, she felt safe with him because
she could be herself and he would not get mad at her.
She reported that this quality about Mark attracted her
to him. Mark, who had initially reported feeling humiliated
by Anne’s rejection, responded to Anne’s soft
disclosure by saying, “I’m kind of surprised by that. I
know that is an important feeling for her, but I didn’t
realize she was feeling that back then.” Anne said that
she had not realized she felt that way either, until describing
the incident in the therapy session.

By the end of Session 1, Dr. S had a good understanding
of Anne and Mark’s history together, the qualities
that first attracted each to the other, and some idea
of their problem areas. The next two individual sessions
helped Dr. S “fill-in” any missing information that he
needed for their formulation.

Sessions 2 and 3

Dr. S introduced these individual sessions with a brief
orientation, followed by an introduction to the ongoing
assessment of the couple’s problem areas:

“There are a lot of different topics that we’ll be covering
today as we go along. I’d like to spend some
time clarifying some of the problems both you and
[Anne/Mark] have had. In our first meeting, you described
some problems that you’ve perceived about
[problem area]. Can you tell me what you meant by
that?”

In addition to the problems that Anne and Mark
raised in their conjoint session, Dr. S used the individual
sessions to address problem areas that Anne and
Mark had indicated on the Frequency and Acceptability
of Partner Behavior Questionnaire:

“When I looked over your list of problem areas, the
item of most concern to you was [problem area]. Can
you describe that to me?”

Dr. S was very specific in his efforts to get Anne and
Mark to describe their disagreements and arguments.
To encourage Mark and Anne to be behaviorally specific
in these descriptions, Dr. S used probing questions:


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

“Do the two of you have fights about [problem area]?
What do those fights look like?”

“When you are both angry, what do you tend to do?”

“Describe for me your most recent argument. Describe
for me the worst argument you’ve ever
had. If I had a video camera there with you, what
would I have seen?”

In addition to understanding their conflict patterns,
Dr. S also asked how problems were addressed in their
families growing up (“How did your own parents deal
with conflict?”). This information may be useful in understanding
the developmental history and emotional
vulnerabilities that each partner brings into a conflict,
and the patterns that each may risk repeating or is trying
to avoid (e.g., physical violence).

When eliciting descriptions of Anne and Mark’s arguments,
Dr. S also assessed whether the couple had
ever engaged in physical violence. This assessment is
a critical part of every couple therapy evaluation, and
it is a major rationale for conducting these individual
interviews. A simple direct question is useful here:

“Have your arguments ever led to pushing, shoving,
or any type of physical violence?”

If either partner endorses this question, or has indicated
violence on a questionnaire such as the CTS2, a
more thorough assessment of violence should be conducted,
and appropriate referrals should be made as
indicated (Jacobson & Gottman, 1998). In this case example,
violence was not an issue for Anne and Mark.4

Finally, the individual sessions provide a good opportunity
for the therapist to assess each partner’s
level of commitment to the relationship. This assessment
also includes inquiry as to whether one or both
partners are engaging in extramarital affairs. Affairs
require special treatment in IBCT (Jacobson & Christensen,
1998), which is beyond the scope of this chapter.
Fortunately, Anne and Mark’s relationship was not
troubled by affairs. With Anne and Mark individually,
Dr. S asked:

“On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your level
of commitment to [Mark/Anne]?”

By the end of Anne’s and Mark’s respective assessment
sessions, Dr. S had sufficient information about
their problem areas, patterns of conflict (including their

lack of a history of violence), relevant family history,
and level of commitment to come up with their formulation
and proceed with their feedback session.

Feedback and Formulation

Session 4

Dr. S began the feedback session by orienting Anne and
Mark about what to expect, and also eliciting their participation
in giving him feedback about his formulation
and description of their problem areas:

“During this session, I’d like to share with you some
feedback, as I mentioned in our first session together.
I’ve spent some time looking over your questionnaires,
and we’ve spent some time talking, which has
been very helpful in helping me get a better sense
of the two of you. As I go along, I’d really like your
input, your reactions, because that’s an important
part of our work together—with you both responding,
as opposed to me directing, interjecting any
thoughts you have, as well as adding any information
that fits or telling me when information doesn’t fit.”

Dr. S began giving Anne and Mark feedback by ex


plaining the information gathered from questionnaires

they completed:

“The measures we gave you were designed to give us
a sense of where you are as a couple, in terms of the
range of couples, from the very happily married to
those with “everyday,” normal distress, to the other
end of the spectrum—couples who are very similar
to ones who have divorced. Both of you are in the
area of couples who are experiencing distress, couples
who would like things to be better. You are both
distressed, although Anne reported higher levels of
distress.”

Dr. S moved on to summarize Anne’s and Mark’s

levels of commitment, which he characterizes as a

strength for their work on therapy:

“With regard to commitment, both of you are committed
to the relationship, which is very important
to both of you. And that is very important in couple
work—that in spite of everything that has gone on,
there is still the commitment. That is very telling—
you’ve both shown and expressed that.”


Couple Distress 723

Dr. S then moved on to summarize the content of
Anne and Mark’s problem areas. Dr. S had distilled
their questionnaire data and their in-session descriptions
to the following three basic problem areas:

“So let’s talk about the areas of your relationship that
are troubling. One area is finances; that tends to be
an area of dispute. For you, Anne, feeling resentful
sometimes, feeling the burden of the responsibility,
and for you, Mark, feeling guilty about how things
are financially. This area really brings out lots of different
feelings—feelings of resentment, feelings of
guilt, feelings of burden—and rather than feelings of
closeness and togetherness, feelings of control. Does
that sound accurate? Are there any other aspects of
finances that the two of you can think of?

“The other area I saw was with regard to Anne’s
children. You both feel very differently about the
subject of Anne’s children: Anne, you feel like Mark
is not involved with your children, and Mark, you
feel as though you have not been invited. For you,
Mark, the experience of being rejected [by the children]
is Anne’s fault. This is an area that brings out
very strong feelings for both of you, whether it gets
expressed directly or not. You may not talk about it,
but I definitely got the sense that this is a real pressure
cooker for both of you. This is an area that I
imagine will come up in different ways, especially
with the holidays coming up.

“The third area I saw concerns responsiveness.
‘How responsive are you to me?’ Whether you are
being physical (‘You’re not responsive enough’ or
‘You’re too responsive’), listening (‘Are you listening
to me?’), touching, or asking a question, your actions
can carry a message of what you want to express, or
a feeling that you are having. So part of what we will
work on is expressing those feelings you are having.
Those may be a surprise for each of you.”

Throughout each of his descriptions, Dr. S checked
in with Anne and Mark for their feedback about each
problem area, and the ways that they might add to his
description.

Even during this part of the feedback session, an opportunity
for acceptance work presented itself. When
Mark discussed his relationship with Anne’s children,
he was initially making only “hard” disclosures, by
describing her children as rude, and only able to talk
about themselves. Because Mark made such critical
statements about Anne’s children, Dr. S elicited from

Mark some softer disclosures about his emotions with
regard to Anne’s children:

Dr. S: Besides them being rude, what is the feeling
you are left with when [Anne’s children] don’t talk
to you?

mark: The feeling I’m left with is being ignored.

Dr. s: Besides being ignored, how did it feel?

mark: Like I don’t matter, like I am only there to serve
them.

Dr. s: Like you are not a part of the family.

mark: Yeah. I think I’ve just resigned myself to hoping
that they’ll show their love for their mother.

Dr. s: So it upsets you that they don’t take an interest
in their mother? So it isn’t just about you, you have
some feelings about how Anne’s sons interact with
her?

mark: Yeah, yeah, I do.

Dr. s: And that upsets you?

mark: Yeah, it does. I feel protective. I’d like them to
show more appreciation to her. But then, I’d like myself
to show more appreciation to her. I don’t think I
show enough appreciation to her. Maybe they’re related
. . . it’s a reminder of the things I’m not doing
well.

By moving Mark from criticizing Anne’s children to

making softer statements about his feelings, Dr. S gave

Mark an unexpected opportunity to make important

realizations about his own behavior—his emotional

sensitivity.
After reviewing their problem areas, Dr. S proceed


ed to describe the two themes he had observed from his

assessment of Anne and Mark:

“It seems to me from what you’ve both described in
your individual sessions, your questionnaires, and
even today, there are two themes that come up for
you. When I say ‘theme,’ it’s like in our sessions;
whatever the topic is for the day, there’s usually a
theme. The theme is something I’ll bring up from
time to time. Again, it’s clearly something that we’ll
work on together. It may take a different form, so I
want to share it with you to make sure that it’s on the
mark, OK?

“I think the first theme is that you both have feelings
of being unloved and unappreciated. You have


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

an idea of what it means to be loved. You have an
idea of what it means to be appreciated. But your definitions
are different. And because of those different
definitions, because of your different experiences, if
something does happen, it leaves you feeling unappreciated
and unloved. Within the arguments about
finances or children, there is something about that—
about feeling unappreciated. How does that sound to
you?

“The second theme is that you both have your insecurities.
You both have feelings of insecurity, for
whatever reason. Some of the arguments, the differences,
the conflicts, the big fights, come from that
also. That feeling comes up and can create the whole
battle. A concrete example is that you, Anne, described
feeling insecure about yourself in relation to
some of your family members. That affects how you
feel about yourself in comparison to other women.
Mark, you described feeling insecure about the fact
that Anne has not annulled her previous marriage.
That may affect how confident you feel in comparison
to other men. Again, these feelings of insecurity,
feeling not loved, unappreciated—these are the
themes.”

After Dr. S described each theme—some of the related
differences, emotional sensitivities, and external
stressors—and received feedback from Anne and Mark
about these themes, he moved on to discuss their pattern
of communication or polarization and the resultant
mutual trap:

“Now, what is this thing we call the ‘trap’ that you
both get into? You each have different ways of responding
to feeling unloved and insecure. The sense
that I get is that, Mark, when you start to feel those
things, you use distance. The sense I get from you,
Anne, is that you become critical. Put the two of you
together, and you have a cycle: The feelings come
up, Mark gets distant, and Anne gets critical. Mark
feels criticism, he gets distant. Anne experiences the
distance, she gets critical. Distance, criticism, criticism,
distance. That’s what we call the trap. It may
be that you take turns being critical and distant, and
that each response makes the other person feel even
more insecure.”

After reviewing the polarization process and mutual

trap, Dr. S proceeded to explain to Anne and Mark

what to expect from the upcoming therapy sessions:

“So this is what we’re going to do in the upcoming
weeks, the kinds of things we’ve talked about today.
We’ll talk about whatever is going on for the two of
you on a given day. It isn’t going to be structured in
terms of things we have to do each day—it’s up to
you, whatever you bring in.

“What I hope to do is create in here a place of
comfort, enough that you can both take risks in
opening up, in sharing—sharing some of your reactions,
your questions, your experiences. There is a
desire for closeness here that is going to take some
sharing and some risk taking. Now, there’s no guarantee
about how the other person is going to react. It
may not always be pleasant. But on the other hand,
that’s the price we have to pay to get there, to open
up. You can do some more thinking about this and
from week to week we can reformulate, and we’ll
keep getting a clearer, better picture.”

Having set the stage with the formulation, including the
themes, the DEEP analysis, and mutual trap, Dr. S is
prepared to begin work on building acceptance.

Treatment: Building Acceptance

Most of Anne and Mark’s subsequent sessions were
focused on building acceptance. Below are excerpts
from a few sessions in which Dr. S helped Anne and
Mark to increase acceptance by using techniques such
as empathic joining, unified detachment, and tolerance
building.

Session 12

The content of this session is about Anne and Mark’s
search for a condominium, and some of the difficulties
they were experiencing. The discussion includes
Mark’s admission that he feels inadequate and insecure
because he does not make enough money for
them to afford Anne’s dream condo. This led to an
opportunity to explore Anne and Mark’s theme of insecurity:


mark: If we settle for a condominium that we don’t
really want, it will forever be a monument to my inability
to get the condo she wants.

Dr. S: I’m wondering if there’s another part that wonders,
“Will I ever really be able to give her what she
wants?”


Couple Distress 725

mark: Yeah. If she married somebody who had a lot
of money, she could get whatever condo she wanted.

anne: But if you married someone who was gorgeous,
who was 20 years younger, you could have a trophy
wife, but that’s not what happened. (Both laugh.)

Dr. S: So that may be part of your insecurity. If you
looked the way that you experience as “the way he
wants things,” then maybe he’d be happier.

mark: (to Dr. S) I think that’s how she feels about herself
at her worst moments. Like maybe all men are
attracted to younger women and that you have to harness
yourself not to lose what’s important to you . . .
(to Anne) maybe that’s how you look at your desire
to have your dream condo. How do you keep from
saying, “There’s that rich lawyer who looks at me all
of the time”? ... (to Dr. S) I think that would be a
pretty natural thing for her to think about.

This dialogue also reveals the unified detachment
Anne and Mark are developing, when they both laugh
at Anne’s comment about a “trophy wife.” What has
previously been a very painful subject for Anne is
becoming something about which they can joke. The
discussion then moved to exploring Anne’s insecurities
about Mark’s relationships with other women:

Dr. S: So what in your eyes is Mark’s ideal “bill”? You
made reference to a “bill” that is his ideal.

anne: Well, probably someone younger, who is able to
have children, someone who plays tennis, who goes
running and also cooks and cleans, makes a good
living, is very good in bed . . .

Dr. S: (to Mark) Because this is comparable to the richer
man that you view with Anne. (to Anne) For you,
it’s the woman who . . .

anne: But that woman’s out there. A lot of women are
like that.

Dr. S: And the way that you see and experience Mark
talking to women. And at times you kind of wonder
to what extent he enjoys it, and you think it’s just a
matter of time if you’re not willing to live up to it . . .

anne: Right, that some other women is going to be
able to step right in there without a problem.

Dr. S: When the insecurities come up for both of you.
For you, Mark, it’s the rich man who could come
along and provide what Anne longs for, and for you,
Anne, it’s that you don’t compete physically—with

the workout—so it’s just a matter of time until a
woman comes along and decides, “I’m going after
him.” Anne, can you tell me some of the things Mark
does that make you feel threatened?

anne: When he makes comments about how attractive
a woman is, like I’m one of the guys. When he tells
me I’m fat, or makes comments like I have a double
chin . ..

Dr. S: Which then tells you that you’re not cutting it.

anne: Yeah.

Dr. S then brought back the subject of condominium
buying, and used this as a metaphor for Anne and
Mark’s concerns about “settling” for less than what
they want in making a major commitment:

Dr. S: When you make a commitment, whether it’s committing
to a condo, committing to a relationship—it’s
settling, you’re settling—you’re saying, “This is it.”

anne: That’s a good way of looking at it. I hadn’t
thought of that. That’s what we’re having trouble
with . . . the reality that we’re not going to get everything
that we want. The insecurity, the scariness
of making the purchase, is knowing that we’re never
going to get what we want.

mark: Part of it is our concern that the next condominium
we see is going to be the one we want.

anne: Right, it’s the condo over the next hill.

mark: So you have to think, “Is 60% of what we want
what we should settle for?” I’m thinking, 60? I was
thinking it’s more like 90. So I don’t know when
you’re supposed to cut your losses and say we have
to go for this—this is what reality dictates.

Dr. S: And if we can take it a step further, it might be
that when you both decided to get married, you both
made a settlement. You both start to wonder whether
the other settled for 60 or 90%. You wonder, “What
did I settle for? Did I settle for 60 or 90%?”

mark: Yeah.

anne: Right.

Dr. S: Now let’s put yourselves in a situation where
you’re insecure. What’s gonna happen? When you’re
in an insecure place, that 90% might feel like . . .

anne: 50%.

Dr. S: Exactly. When you’re feeling good, you think,
“She got 90% of what she wanted in me,” or “I got


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

90%.” But when you’re in an insecure place, you
think, “I settled for 50%.” Then when you look at
your own insecurity, you think, “My God, she settled
for 35 or 40%.” You both made a settlement when
you married each other. You decided, “This is it,
we’re gonna get married,” and you settled.

mark: But “settled” has such negative connotations.
Dr. S: I think there’s some feelings associated with
that. And a parallel to the word “settlement” is “acceptance.”


mark: Oh, I see.

Dr. S: When you go through the settlement, you think,
“This is who this person is.” Whether it’s 90, 80, 60,
or 35%, you’ve settled—you’ve basically said, “I accept
this.”

By using condominium buying as a metaphor, Dr.
S has underscored how Anne and Mark’s theme of
insecurity feeds itself, and how it leads them both to
question whether each has “settled” for less than he/she
wanted in the relationship. Adding the additional component
of “insecurity about settlement” to their theme
helped Anne and Mark understand the things each of
them do that “threaten” the other (e.g., when Mark
talks about his attraction to younger women), and also
build a bridge toward working on acceptance.

Session 17

In this session, Dr. S continues to process the theme
of insecurity with Anne and Mark. In this particular
part of the dialogue, when Anne and Mark are discussing
a familiar polarization process, Mark suggests to
Anne that she work out more. Anne interprets Mark’s
suggestion as a criticism about her appearance, which
makes her feel insecure and threatened. Anne then
“fights back” against Mark’s suggestions by becoming
depressed and “doing nothing,” which in turn makes
Mark more critical of her.

Here Dr. S uses two IBCT acceptance-building techniques.
The first technique is empathic joining. As Dr.
S tries to “get to the bottom of” Mark’s suggestions/
criticisms of Anne’s appearance, Mark makes the following
soft disclosure about his own insecurities:

Dr. S: This is a real, central question. There are some
basic limits that you have, where you say, “Up to here,
I accept you, but beyond that, you’d better change.”
On the other hand, this is who you are. This is who

you are. But the irony of it is, that once we accept,
change can come about. But there’s that push to determine
within ourselves not only the other person’s
limits but also our own. I get the sense that you’re
both exploring yourselves and your own limits.

anne: Perhaps, yes.

Dr. S: You’re both looking at your own limits. With
you, Anne, it’s about your looks, your appearance.
And for you, Mark, it’s about you as a financial provider.
And the temptation is, when that gets uncomfortable,
that’s where your partner comes in kind of,
to redirect your focus from that versus being able to
talk about how you’re feeling.

anne: Yeah.

mark: Yeah, I think I’ve noticed, since we’ve started
therapy, that’s what I do. When I get insecure about
myself, I start looking outwards, saying, “You should
do this,” and that makes me feel better.

Dr. S: Right, it’s active. It can be advice giving—it can
be a real male thing, “Do this, do that.”
mark: Right, I do that with her kids, too. I know I do.

Instead of focusing on the critical nature of Mark’s
suggestions, Dr. S has placed an emphasis on why Mark
becomes critical. Mark is encouraged to consider the
reasons for his behavior, and as a result he discloses
that he becomes critical when he himself is feeling
insecure. Mark recognizes that this happens not only
with regard to his attempts to direct Anne’s behavior
but also in his interactions with Anne’s children.

The second acceptance-building technique Dr. S
uses in this portion of the session is a tolerance intervention:
emphasizing the positive aspects of a partner’s
negative behavior. Dr. S continues:

Dr. S: In some situations it might work really well [to
give advice]. People might like that—like in your
work as a counselor, Mark. You feel really productive.


mark: Yeah, I change people’s lives. I know I do.

Dr. S: On the other hand, there might be some circumstances
where it’s experienced as being critical, and
I think of this in terms of the two of you. It feeds into
Anne’s feeling criticized.

anne: Yes.

Dr. S: And then it feels threatening, like “If you don’t
do something about it, then . . . ”


Couple Distress

Here Dr. S has positively reemphasized Mark’s suggestions
to Anne as his attempts to give her guidance
or advice. Mark, an employment counselor, is used to
giving such suggestions to others as a way of being
constructive or helpful. Dr. S underscores this aspect
of Mark’s behavior—that this same “counselor” quality
makes Mark very good at what he does in his career.
However, Dr. S does not try to reframe Mark’s behavior
as completely positive. Dr. S also underscores how
Mark’s “advice” is experienced by Anne as critical and
threatening.

At the end of the session, Dr. S recharacterizes Anne
and Mark’s polarization process in terms of the information
that has emerged from these two interventions:

Dr. S: I think you put it really well, Mark. When you
start to feel uncomfortable, this is your process, this
is what you do. You start to look outside yourself.
From your end, it might be like you’re being a counselor
when you start with Anne. You want to advise.
But from her end, it might be like you’re being authoritarian,
the drill sergeant, rather than the counselor.
And you, Anne, start to feel you’re being berated.
You start to feel worse about yourself.

anne: Yeah.

Dr. S: So you feel like you’ve gotta either take it, or
you’ve gotta fight back.
mark: I think I can . . . the fighting back is . . . well, I
can understand that. I really can.

Session 25

In their final session, Anne described a recent insight
she had had about feeling “undeserving” of happiness,
and her belief that happiness comes at a cost of some
kind. She said that happiness made her feel guilty because
she felt that someone else must be suffering for
her happiness, or that somehow she would suffer negative
repercussions for being happy. Anne connected
some of these feelings to her bout with an eating disorder
as a teenager, and to the depressive episodes she
sometimes experienced as an adult.

In the dialogue below, Dr. S uses several IBCT techniques
to discuss Anne’s insights and the way that her
feelings contribute to the couple’s polarization process.
First, Dr. S uses empathic joining to help Mark understand
the experience Anne is having when she gets
depressed (a time when Mark regularly makes suggestions
about how Anne “should” think, feel, or be


have). Then Dr. S detaches Anne and Mark from their
problem—that Anne feels criticized whenever Mark
makes these suggestions. Rather than engaging Anne
and Mark in their emotional responses to each other’s
behavior, Dr. S framed this problem as a consequence
of basic communication problems. By describing their
problem in terms of their methods of communication,
Dr. S detaches Anne and Mark from the problem itself,
and provides each with a new way of reacting to an
old problem (without doing any formal communication
training):

Dr. S: I think the idea around the conflict over
happiness—having the happiness—is like savoring
a good meal, and that it will cost you: “OK, so it has
some high fat, but I’m going to enjoy it because I
deserve this, I deserve this moment—the same way
that I deserve this moment of happiness, even if soand-
so doesn’t have it together. I deserve this happiness.”
And that’s going to be the struggle, to be able
to react to Mark in a way that expresses, “God, I’m
really feeling guilty.”

anne: When I’m on the couch, and I’m totally immobile
in my depression, that’s a lot of what’s going on.
I’m beating myself up.

Dr. S: And so Mark needs to listen, to just listen and
say, “Gee, that must be really hard.” Now there may
be a pull, Mark, to problem-solve, to say, “Well, you
shouldn’t feel that way,” or “So-and-so is that way
because . . . ,” but that will only bring out Anne’s
self-criticism and it could become argumentative.
When you sense the pain, Mark, and what it’s costing
Anne, the reaction that you have is “Let me show
you what to do.” But that is only going to bring out
in Anne the feeling of “You see, you idiot, you’re
not doing it right,” which will then feed into the
self-criticism. So it’s going to help to just listen, and
simply to paraphrase, and she will hear that it’s not
reasonable. If, rather than criticizing, you just say,
“Gee, you really don’t feel worthy of these things,”
if you just paraphrase those themes of her insecurity,
her self-criticalness, that is kind of maintaining
a connection.

Finally, Dr. S uses tolerance interventions to allow
Anne and Mark to see their problem as a difference in
their communication styles. As he continues to describe
their problem in terms of communication difficulties,
Dr. S describes Anne as responding to situations based


CliniCAl HAnDBook of PsyCHologiCAl DisorDers

on how she feels, while Mark is more likely to use logic
or reason to determine his responses to situations. Dr. S
also points out how Anne and Mark’s problem is often a
result of this difference, and that these differences actually
complement one another:

Dr. S: (to Mark) And that’s what I want to encourage,
maybe a new way of responding rather than using
reason when you start to feel like Anne’s feelings
don’t make sense. Rather than saying, “This doesn’t
make sense,” say instead, “What I’m hearing you say
is that you don’t deserve this”—whatever it is. And
what I’m expecting, Anne, is that to hear Mark express
that he understands you would make you feel
close to him.

anne: Yeah, and it would definitely not be the wedge
of “you should.” (Mark laughs.)

Dr. S: Anne, you talk about things from the emotional
experience, and Mark, you talk about things from
the rational experience—and both are needed, both
are important.

This section of the dialogue also reveals how Anne
and Mark have developed unified detachment from
their problem. Anne uses the phrase “the wedge of ‘you
should’ ” to describe what had previously been the “hot
topic” of feeling criticized by Mark, and Mark is able to
laugh about his own behavior.

coNclusioN

Although a single case study is useful for illustrative
purposes, it obviously does not establish generalizable
conclusions about treatment outcome. However, the
studies we have described give some promising results
for the efficacy of IBCT.

IBCT is part of what Hayes (2004) has called the
“third wave” of behavior therapy. The “first wave”
encompassed traditional classical and operant conditioning
approaches. The “second wave” incorporated
cognitive strategies. The third wave emphasizes “contextual
and experiential change strategies in addition to
more direct and didactic ones” (p. 6). Acceptance and
mindfulness are key aspects of these third-wave therapies.
Although these therapies have generated considerable
enthusiasm and confirming data, only additional
outcome research will establish whether these therapies
in general or IBCT in particular will work to alleviate

human suffering, including the substantial suffering
that occurs in couple relationships, in more powerful
ways than the first two waves of behavior therapy.

notes

1. We use the more inclusive term “couple therapy” rather
than the more limited “marital therapy,” because “couple
therapy” can refer to unmarried couples, gay and lesbian
couples, as well as married couples.
2. Identifying information has been changed to protect confidentiality,
but clinical dynamics are accurately portrayed
and quotations are taken directly from tapes of the therapy
sessions but altered slightly to increase readability.
3. Not included here are case examples of the application of
TBCT interventions, which can be found elsewhere (e.g.,
Cordova & Jacobson, 1993; Jacobson & Margolin, 1979).
4. In our project we assessed for violence using the CTS2 and
excluded any couple in which the wife reported moderate
to severe violence from the husband. We excluded the
partners prior to their seeing one of our project therapists,
and we referred them to appropriate individual treatment
for violence. Dr. S could proceed with the knowledge that
the wife had not endorsed this kind of violence from her
husband on the CTS2 (although she could still do so in the
individual session). In a clinical setting, we recommend
that practitioners give the Couple Questionnaire or the
CTS2 to all clients and follow up with individual sessions,
in which they focus specifically on violent items on the
questionnaire that the individual has endorsed as committing
or receiving. Based on these interviews, the practitioner
should refer clients when appropriate (Jacobson &
Gottman, 1998).
