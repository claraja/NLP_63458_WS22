Symptoms - Anorexia

The main symptom of anorexia is deliberately losing a lot of weight or keeping your body weight much lower than is healthy for your age and height.

Signs and symptoms include:

    missing meals, eating very little or avoid eating any foods you see as fattening
    lying about what and when you've eaten, and how much you weigh
    taking medicine to reduce your hunger (appetite suppressants), such as slimming or diet pills
    exercising excessively, making yourself sick, or using medicine to help you poo (laxatives) or to make you pee (diuretics) to try to avoid putting on weight
    an overwhelming fear of gaining weight
    strict rituals around eating
    seeing losing a lot of weight as a positive thing
    believing you're fat when you're a healthy weight or underweight
    not admitting your weight loss is serious

You may also notice physical signs and symptoms such as:

    if you're under 18, your weight and height being lower than expected for your age
    if you're an adult, having an unusually low body mass index (BMI)
    your periods stopping (in women who have not reached menopause) or not starting (in younger women and girls)
    bloating, constipation and abdominal pain
    headaches or problems sleeping
    feeling cold, dizzy or very tired
    poor circulation in hands and feet
    dry skin, hair loss from the scalp, or fine downy hair growing on the body
    reduced sex drive

People with anorexia often have other mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety.
Warning signs of anorexia in someone else

The following warning signs could indicate that someone you care about has an eating disorder:

    dramatic weight loss
    lying about how much and when they've eaten, or how much they weigh
    avoiding eating with others
    cutting their food into small pieces or eating very slowly to disguise how little they're eating
    trying to hide how thin they are by wearing loose or baggy clothes

In children with anorexia, puberty and the associated growth spurt may be delayed. Young people with anorexia may gain less weight than expected and may be smaller than children of the same age.
