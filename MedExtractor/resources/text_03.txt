Symptoms - Agoraphobia
The severity of agoraphobia can vary significantly between individuals.

For example, someone with severe agoraphobia may be unable to leave the house, whereas someone who has mild agoraphobia may be able to travel short distances without problems.

The symptoms of agoraphobia can be broadly classified into 3 types:

physical
cognitive
behavioural
Physical symptoms
The physical symptoms of agoraphobia usually only occur when you find yourself in a situation or environment that causes anxiety.

However, many people with agoraphobia rarely experience physical symptoms because they deliberately avoid situations that make them anxious.

The physical symptoms of agoraphobia can be similar to those of a panic attack and may include:

rapid heartbeat
rapid breathing (hyperventilating)
feeling hot and sweaty
feeling sick
chest pain
difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
diarrhoea
trembling
dizziness
ringing in the ears (tinnitus)
feeling faint
Cognitive symptoms
The cognitive symptoms of agoraphobia are feelings or thoughts that can be, but aren't always, related to the physical symptoms.

Cognitive symptoms may include fear that:

a panic attack will make you look stupid or feel embarrassed in front of other people
a panic attack will be life threatening – for example, you may be worried your heart will stop or you'll be unable to breathe
you would be unable to escape from a place or situation if you were to have a panic attack
you're losing your sanity
you may lose control in public
you may tremble and blush in front of people
people may stare at you
There are also psychological symptoms that aren't related to panic attacks, such as:

feeling you would be unable to function or survive without the help of others
a fear of being left alone in your house (monophobia)
a general feeling of anxiety or dread
Behavioural symptoms
Symptoms of agoraphobia relating to behaviour include:

avoiding situations that could lead to panic attacks, such as crowded places, public transport and queues
being housebound – not being able to leave the house for long periods of time
needing to be with someone you trust when going anywhere
avoiding being far away from home
Some people are able to force themselves to confront uncomfortable situations, but they feel considerable fear and anxiety while doing so.

When to seek medical advice
