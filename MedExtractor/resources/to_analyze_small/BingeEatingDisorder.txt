Overview - Binge eating disorder

Binge eating disorder involves regularly eating a lot of food over a short period of time until you're uncomfortably full.

Binges are often planned in advance, usually done alone, and may include "special" binge foods. You may feel guilty or ashamed after binge eating.

Men and women of any age can get binge eating disorder, but it usually starts in the late teens or early 20s.
Symptoms of binge eating disorder

The main symptom of binge eating disorder is eating a lot of food in a short time and not being able to stop when full. Other symptoms include:

    eating when not hungry
    eating very fast during a binge
    eating alone or secretly
    feeling depressed, guilty, ashamed or disgusted after binge eating

People who regularly eat in this way may have binge eating disorder.
Warning signs of binge eating disorder in someone else

Someone you care about may have an eating disorder if they:

    eat a lot of food, very quickly
    try to hide how much they're eating
    store up supplies of food
    put on weight (but this does not happen to everyone with binge eating disorder)
