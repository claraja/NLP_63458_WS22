Overview – Eating disorders

An eating disorder is a mental health condition where you use the control of food to cope with feelings and other situations.

Unhealthy eating behaviours may include eating too much or too little or worrying about your weight or body shape.

Anyone can get an eating disorder, but teenagers between 13 and 17 are mostly affected.

With treatment, most people can recover from an eating disorder.
Types of eating disorders

The most common eating disorders are:

    anorexia nervosa – trying to control your weight by not eating enough food, exercising too much, or doing both
    bulimia – losing control over how much you eat and then taking drastic action to not put on weight
    binge eating disorder (BED) – eating large portions of food until you feel uncomfortably full

Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED)

A person may have an OSFED if their symptoms do not exactly fit the expected symptoms for any specific eating disorders.

OSFED is the most common eating disorder.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)

ARFID is when someone avoids certain foods, limits how much they eat or does both.

Beliefs about weight or body shape are not reasons why people develop ARFID.

Possible reasons for ARFID include:

    negative feelings over the smell, taste or texture of certain foods
    a response to a past experience with food that was upsetting, for example, choking or being sick after eating something
    not feeling hungry or just a lack of interest in eating

Warning signs of an eating disorder in someone else

It can be very difficult to identify that a loved one or friend has developed an eating disorder.

Warning signs to look out for include:

    dramatic weight loss
    lying about how much they've eaten, when they've eaten, or their weight
    eating a lot of food very fast
    going to the bathroom a lot after eating
    exercising a lot
    avoiding eating with others
    cutting food into small pieces or eating very slowly
    wearing loose or baggy clothes to hide their weight loss
