Symptoms - Bulimia

The main signs of bulimia are eating a large amount of food over a very short time (binge eating) and then ridding your body of the extra food (purging) by making yourself vomit, taking laxatives or exercising excessively, or a combination of these.

Other signs of bulimia include: 

    fear of putting on weight
    being very critical about your weight and body shape

You may also notice physical signs like:
