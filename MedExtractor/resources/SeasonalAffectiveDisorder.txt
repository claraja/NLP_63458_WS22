Symptoms - Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)

The symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) are similar to those of normal depression, but they occur repetitively at a particular time of year.

They usually start in the autumn or winter and improve in the spring.

The nature and severity of SAD varies from person to person. For some, it may be mild while for others it can be severe and have a significant impact on their day-to-day life.
Depression

Signs that you may be depressed include:

    a persistent low mood
    a loss of pleasure or interest in normal everyday activities
    feeling irritable
    feelings of despair, guilt and worthlessness
    low self-esteem
    tearfulness
    feeling stressed or anxious
    a reduced sex drive
    becoming less sociable

A small number of people will experience these symptoms in phases that are separated by "manic" periods where they feel happy, energetic and much more sociable.
Other symptoms

In addition to symptoms of depression, you may also:

    be less active than normal
    feel lethargic (lacking in energy) and sleepy during the day
    sleep for longer than normal and find it hard to get up in the morning
    find it difficult to concentrate
    have an increased appetite â€“ some people have a particular craving for foods containing lots of carbohydrates and end up gaining weight as a result

These symptoms may make everyday activities increasingly difficult.
